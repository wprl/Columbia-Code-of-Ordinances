<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any nuisance abated by the director extended over more than

abating the nuisance shall be assessed against each parcel of land on which the nuisance was 
abated in proportion to the amount of work and expense for each such parcel. &nbsp;Except in the case 
of an emergency abatement, however, no parcel of land shall be assessed unless an owner of the 
parcel was served with an abatement notice.</div>
