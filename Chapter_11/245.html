<p class=texthead>Section 11-245 Nuisances attributable to neighboring property.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any nuisance abated by the director was caused in whole or 
in part by activities on 
neighboring property, the cost of abating the nuisance shall be assessed against each parcel of 
such neighboring property in proportion to the &nbsp;amount of damage attributable to each such 
parcel. &nbsp;Except in the case of an emergency abatement, however, no property shall be assessed 
unless an owner of the property was served with an abatement notice. The owner of such 
property shall be entitled to the same hearing and appeal rights as the owner of property on 
which a nuisance is alleged to exist.</div>
