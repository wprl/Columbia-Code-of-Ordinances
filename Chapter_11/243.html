<p class=texthead>Section 11-243 Emergency abatement.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The director may abate any nuisance without following the 
abatement procedures of this 
article if the nuisance presents an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of any 
inhabitant of the city.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The director may assess the cost, including administrative 
costs, of abating a nuisance 
under this section against the property on which the nuisance was located. &nbsp;Before assessing 
costs, the director shall serve a bill of costs on the property owner. &nbsp;The bill of costs shall 
describe the nuisance that was abated, state the cost of abatement and inform the owner of the 
right and manner of requesting a hearing.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The bill of costs shall be served on the property owner 
by first class mail, or by personal 
service in the same manner as legal process is served under any Missouri statute or court rule. 
Mailed notice shall be presumed received three (3) days after it is mailed. &nbsp;If service is not 
able 
to be obtained by either of the above methods, service may be obtained by publishing notice of 
the bill of costs in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The property owner may contest the assessment of costs by 
requesting a hearing. &nbsp;The 
request for hearing must be made in writing and received by the director within seven (7) days of 
service of the bill of costs or publication of notice of the bill of costs. &nbsp;The request for hearing 
must be either hand-delivered to the office of the director or sent to the director by United States 
mail, facsimile machine or electronic mail. &nbsp;The request for hearing must state an address to 
which a notice of hearing may be sent.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Notice of hearing.</i> &nbsp;At least ten (10) days written notice of the hearing shall be given 
to the 
property owner. &nbsp;Notice shall be hand-delivered to the property owner or mailed to the address 
provided by the property owner in the request for hearing. Notice shall be presumed received 
three (3) days after it is mailed.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Hearing</i> <i>and decision.</i> &nbsp;The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing and enter a 
decision in 
accordance with the requirements of chapter 536, RSMo. &nbsp;If the hearing officer determines that 
the abatement was justified under subsection (a), the hearing officer shall certify the cost of 
abatement to the city clerk for collection pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 11-242.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <span style="font-size:11pt">
