<p class=texthead>Section 11-269 Collection of abatement costs.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;If the owner of the property on which the unlicensed, 
dismantled, &nbsp;inoperable or junk-filled 
vehicle was located was served with an abatement notice, the cost of abatement may be assessed 
against the property in the following manner. &nbsp;The director shall certify the cost of abatement 
to 
the city clerk. &nbsp;The cost shall include administrative costs as well as the actual cost of removing 
the vehicle. &nbsp;The city clerk shall cause a special taxbill against the property to be prepared 
in the 
amount of the abatement cost. &nbsp;The taxbill from the date of its issuance shall be a lien on the 
property until paid and shall be prima facie evidence of the recitals therein and of its validity. &nbsp;No 
clerical error or informality in the taxbill or in the proceedings leading up to the issuance of the 
taxbill shall be a defense in an action to collect the taxbill. &nbsp;Taxbills issued under this section, 
if 
not paid when due, shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. The tax bill 
shall constitute a personal obligation of the owner of the property on which the vehicle was 
located.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The cost of abatement shall also constitute a personal 
obligation of the owner of the 
vehicle and the occupant of the property on which the vehicle was located.</div>
