<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Applicability</i>.<i> &nbsp;</i>The provisions of this division, other than the provision for emergency 
abatement, shall apply only to violations of this article that do not have specific abatement 
procedures.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Abatement notice</i>. &nbsp;When an enforcement official determines that a nuisance exists in 
violation of this article, the enforcement official may initiate a nuisance abatement procedure by 
serving an abatement notice on the owner of the property upon which the nuisance is believed to 
exist. &nbsp;The abatement notice shall contain the following:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a 
description of the location and nature of the alleged nuisance,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement of the acts necessary 
to abate the alleged nuisance,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an order establishing the time for 
beginning and completing abatement of the alleged 
nuisance and requiring that abatement activities continue without unreasonable delay,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information on the right and manner 
of requesting a hearing to contest the enforcement 
official&#146;s abatement notice, and</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement that if the nuisance 
is not abated as ordered and if no &nbsp;request for hearing is 
made within the prescribed time, the city may &nbsp;abate the alleged nuisance and assess the costs 
against the property &nbsp;owner and the property.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Service of abatement notice.</i> &nbsp;</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enforcement official shall serve the abatement notice 
on the property owner by first 
class mail or by personal service in the same manner as legal process is served under any 
Missouri statute or court rule. &nbsp;Mailed notice shall be presumed received three (3) days after 
it is 
mailed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the enforcement official is unable 
to obtain service by either of the above methods, 
service may be obtained by publishing the abatement notice once in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the city and by posting the abatement notice on the property where the alleged 
nuisance exists. &nbsp;Notice shall be considered given on the date the notice is published or the notice 
is posted, whichever is later.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Request for hearing. &nbsp;</i>The owner of property on which the nuisance is alleged to exist may 
contest the abatement notice by requesting a hearing. &nbsp;The request for hearing must be made in 
writing and received by the director within seven (7) days of service of the abatement notice. The 
request for hearing must be either hand-delivered to the office of the director or sent to the 
director by United States mail, facsimile machine or electronic mail. &nbsp;The request for hearing 
must state an address to which a notice of hearing may be sent.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Notice of hearing.</i> &nbsp;At least ten (10) days written notice of the hearing shall be given 
to the 
property owner except in cases where the public health, safety or interest shall make a shorter 
time reasonable. &nbsp;Notice shall be hand-delivered to the property owner or mailed to the address 
provided by the property owner in the request for hearing. Notice shall be presumed received 
three (3) days after it is mailed.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Hearing</i> <i>and decision.</i> &nbsp;The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing and enter a 
decision in 
accordance with the requirements of chapter 536, RSMo. &nbsp;If the hearing officer determines that 
a 
nuisance exists as charged in the abatement notice, the hearing officer may enter an order of 
abatement directing that the nuisance be abated under such conditions and within such time as 
the hearing officer deems appropriate under the circumstances.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Appeal.</i> &nbsp;An appeal from the decision of the hearing officer may be made to the circuit 
court of Boone County in accordance with chapter 536, RSMo. </span></div>
