The operator shall obtain proof of age before the tattoo procedure is done.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No patron shall be tattooed unless 
the patron has signed a cautionary notice advising the 
patron that the tattoo should be considered permanent, that it can be removed only with a surgical 
procedure, and that any effective removal may leave permanent scarring and disfigurement. The 
cautionary notice shall be retained on file at the tattoo establishment.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin surface to be tattooed must 
be free of rash, pimples, infection or recent scar 
tissue. The patron must be in apparent good health, and the skin to be tattooed must be generally 
free of all appearances of pathological conditions. The skin must not appear jaundiced 
(yellowed).</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tattoos shall not be administered 
to any person under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
The operator is responsible for making reasonable observation and inquiry to assure himself that 
the patron is sober and not under the influence of drugs.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An operator shall provide written 
instructions, approved by the director, regarding the 
proper care of the tattooed skin as a precaution against infections to each patron following a 
tattoo procedure.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An operator shall not perform or
