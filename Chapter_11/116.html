<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any person is arrested for being a prostitute, a keeper, 
inmate or frequenter of a house of 
ill fame, prostitution or assignation, or for lewd or lascivious conduct, such person shall be 
subjected to a physical examination by the health officer for the purpose of determining if such 
person is infected with a venereal disease in the infectious stage. If such examination should 
reveal that such person is suffering from and afflicted with a venereal disease in the infectious 
stage, such person shall be quarantined and detained in a place provided by the city until such 
time as such person is no longer capable of conveying such disease to others; provided, however, 
that any person so quarantined and detained may, at his option, be cared for at his own expense 
by his own physician.</div>
