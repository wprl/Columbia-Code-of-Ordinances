or contagious disease is or 
may become epidemic in the city, or any part thereof, he shall immediately, or as soon thereafter 
as possible, give notice to that effect to the citizens of the city and the country surrounding the 
same, and shall also give notice of the rules and regulations adopted by him for the enforcement 
of quarantine within the city or portion thereof. He shall take such steps and adopt such measures 
as he may deem necessary to prevent the introduction and spreading of such disease, and to this 
end he shall have power to quarantine the city against persons coming into or leaving the city 
during the continuation of such epidemic. Whenever he shall deem it necessary, he shall have the 
power to forbid and prevent the assembling of congregations of persons within the city and to 
order and enforce the closing of places of business and amusements.</div>
