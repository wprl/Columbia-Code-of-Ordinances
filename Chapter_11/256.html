<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i> &nbsp;Initiation of abatement procedure</i>. &nbsp;When the hearing officer has reason to believe 
that 
weeds have been allowed to grow on any property in violation of this article, the hearing officer 
may initiate an abatement procedure by calling a hearing to determine whether a violation exists.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i> &nbsp;Notice of hearing.</i> &nbsp;The owner of the property on which the violation of this article 
is 
believed to exist shall be given notice of the hearing at least four (4) days before the hearing. The 
notice shall describe the location and nature of the alleged violation and state the time and place 
of the hearing. &nbsp;When there is more than one owner of the property, notice need be given to only 
one of the owners.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i> &nbsp;Service of notice</i>. &nbsp;The notice shall be served by at least one of the following methods:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal service on the owner or 
the owner&#146;s agent,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service by mail addressed to the 
last known address of the owner or the owner&#146;s agent,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting the notice on the property 
where the violation is alleged to exist.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>Notice shall be considered given on the date the notice is personally served, mailed 
or posted.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i> &nbsp;Hearing and order</i>. &nbsp;The hearing officer shall conduct an informal hearing at the 
time and 
place designated in the notice of hearing. &nbsp;If the hearing officer determines, after reviewing 
all 
evidence presented at the hearing, that weeds have been allowed to grow on the subject property 
in violation of this article, the hearing officer may declare the weeds to be a nuisance and order 
them to be abated within five (5) business days. &nbsp;</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i> &nbsp;Abatement by city</i>. &nbsp;If weeds are not cut down and removed as ordered by the hearing 
officer, the hearing officer may have the weeds cut down and removed by city employees or by 
persons under contract with the city. &nbsp;No person shall enter private property containing an 
occupied single family residential structure to abate a weed nuisance unless an owner or 
occupant of the property has consented to the entry or unless the municipal judge has issued a 
warrant for the entry.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i> &nbsp;Collection of abatement costs</i>. &nbsp;The director shall certify the cost of abatement 
to the city 
clerk. &nbsp;The cost shall include administrative costs as well as the actual cost of cutting and 
removing the weeds. &nbsp;The city clerk shall &nbsp;cause a special taxbill against the property to 
be 
prepared in the amount of the abatement cost. &nbsp;The taxbill from the date of its issuance shall 
be a 
lien on the property until paid and shall be prima facie evidence of the recitals therein and of its 
validity. &nbsp;No clerical error or informality in the taxbill or in the proceedings leading up to 
the 
issuance of the taxbill shall be a defense in an action to collect the taxbill. &nbsp;Taxbills issued 
under 
this section, if not paid when due, shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. 
The cost of abatement shall also constitute a personal obligation of the property owner.</span></div>
