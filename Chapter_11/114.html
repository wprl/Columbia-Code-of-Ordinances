<p class=texthead>Section 11-114 Powers and duties of director.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hereby made the duty of the director, and he is hereby 
directed and empowered as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all suspected cases of sexually 
transmitted disease in the infectious stage, owing to the 
prevalence of such diseases among prostitutes, all prostitutes may be considered as suspected 
persons. In such cases the director shall use every available means of determining whether the 
person suspected of being infected is suffering from such disease in the infectious state. 
Whenever such disease is found to exist, the director shall, whenever possible, ascertain the 
source of such infection. In such investigations the director is hereby vested with full powers of 
inspection, examination, isolation and treatment of all persons, places and things as provided in 
this article.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inasmuch as prostitution is a 
prolific source of sexually transmitted infection, the director 
and all other subordinate officers shall use every proper means of suppressing the same, and all 
such officers are hereby prohibited from issuing certificates or other evidences of freedom from 
sexually transmitted disease.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases of gonococcus infection 
shall be regarded by the director as infectious until at least 
two (2) successive bacteriological examinations, taken not less than twenty-four (24) hours apart, 
fail to show gonococci.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director may isolate persons 
infected with any of such sexually transmitted diseases 
in a place provided by the city whenever and as long as isolation is necessary to protect the 
public health.</div>
