<p class=texthead>Section 11-363 Suspension and revocation of permits.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Tattoo establishment permits may be suspended by the director 
for failure of the holder to 
comply with the requirements of this article. Whenever the director finds unsanitary or other 
conditions in the operation of a tattoo establishment which, in his judgment, constitute a 
substantial hazard to the public health, the director may issue a written notice to the permit 
holder citing such condition, specifying the corrective action to be taken, and specifying the time 
period within which such action shall be taken. If deemed a substantial hazard to the public 
health, such order shall state that the permit is immediately suspended and all tattoo operations 
are to be immediately discontinued. Any person to whom such an order is issued shall comply 
immediately, but upon written petition to the director, shall be afforded a hearing within five (5) 
days.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Any person whose permit has been suspended may, at any time, 
make application for a 
reinspection for the purpose of reinstatement of the permit. Within five (5) business days 
following the receipt of a written request, the health authority shall make a reinspection. If the 
applicant is complying with the requirements of this article, the permit shall be reinstated.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) For serious or repeated violations of any of the requirements 
of this article, or for 
interference with the director in the performance of the director's duties, the permit may be 
permanently revoked after an opportunity for a hearing has been provided by the director. Prior 
to such action, the director shall notify the permit holder in writing, stating the reasons for which 
the permit is subject to revocation and advising that the permit shall be permanently revoked at 
the end of ten (10) days following service of such notice, unless a request for a hearing is filed 
with the director, by the permit holder, within such ten-day period. A permit may be suspended 
for cause pending its revocation or a hearing on the revocation. Appeal from the action of the 
director may be made to the circuit court pursuant to Chapter 536, Revised Statutes of Missouri.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The hearings provided for in this section shall be conducted 
by the director in accordance 
with the requirements of Chapter 536, Revised Statutes of Missouri.</div>
