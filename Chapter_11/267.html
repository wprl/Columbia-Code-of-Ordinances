<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Abatement notice</i>. &nbsp;When an enforcement official determines that a nuisance exists in 
violation of this division, the enforcement official may initiate a nuisance abatement procedure 
by serving an abatement notice on the owner of the vehicle and on the occupant of the property 
upon which the nuisance is believed to exist. &nbsp;An abatement notice must be served on the owner 
of the property upon which the nuisance is believed to exist only if abatement costs are to be 
assessed against the property. &nbsp;The abatement notice shall contain the following:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a description of the location and 
nature of the alleged nuisance,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement of the acts necessary to abate the &nbsp;alleged 
nuisance,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an order establishing a deadline 
for abating the alleged nuisance which shall be at least 
thirty (30) days after the abatement order is served,</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information on the right and manner 
of requesting a hearing to contest the enforcement 
official&#146;s abatement notice, and</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement that if the nuisance 
is not abated as ordered and if no &nbsp;request for hearing is 
made within the prescribed time, the city may &nbsp;abate the alleged nuisance by removing the 
vehicle and assess the costs against the owner of the vehicle, against the owner or occupant of 
the property and against the property.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Service of abatement notice.</i> </span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1) &nbsp;The enforcement official shall serve the abatement notice on the owner of 
the vehicle and on 
the occupant of the property by posting the abatement notice in a prominent location on the 
vehicle or on some conspicuous place on the property where the vehicle is located. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enforcement official may serve the abatement notice 
on the property owner by first 
class mail or by personal service in the same manner as legal process is served under any 
Missouri statute or court rule. &nbsp;Mailed notice shall be presumed received three (3) days after 
it is 
mailed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the enforcement official is unable 
to obtain service on the property owner by either of 
the above methods, service may be obtained by publishing the abatement notice once in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the city. &nbsp;Notice shall be considered given on the date the 
notice is published.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Request for hearing. &nbsp;</i>The owner of the vehicle or the owner or occupant of the property 
on 
which the nuisance is alleged to exist may contest the abatement notice by requesting a hearing. 
&nbsp;The request for hearing must be made in writing and received by the director within seven (7) 
days of service of the abatement notice. &nbsp;The request for hearing must be either hand-delivered 
to 
the office of the director or sent to the director by United States mail, facsimile machine or 
electronic mail. &nbsp;The request for hearing must state an address to which a notice of hearing may 
be sent.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Notice of hearing.</i> &nbsp;At least ten (10) days written notice of the hearing shall be given 
to the 
person requesting the hearing except in cases where the public health, safety or interest shall 
make a shorter time reasonable. &nbsp;Notice shall be hand-delivered or mailed to the address provided 
in the request for hearing. Notice shall be presumed received three (3) days after it is mailed.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Hearing</i> <i>and decision.</i> &nbsp;The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing and enter a 
decision 
in accordance with the requirements of chapter 536, RSMo. &nbsp;If the hearing officer determines 
that a nuisance exists as charged in the abatement notice, the hearing officer may enter an order 
of abatement directing that the vehicle be removed or the nuisance be otherwise abated under 
such conditions and within such time as the hearing officer deems appropriate under the 
circumstances.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Appeal.</i> &nbsp;An appeal from the decision of the hearing officer may be made to the circuit
