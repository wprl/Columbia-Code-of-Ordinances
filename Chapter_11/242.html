<p class=texthead>Section 11-242 Collection of abatement costs.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The director shall certify the cost of abatement to the 
city clerk. &nbsp;The cost shall include 
administrative costs as well as the actual cost of abating the nuisance. &nbsp;The city clerk shall 
cause 
a special taxbill against the property to be prepared in the amount of the abatement costs. &nbsp;The 
taxbill from the date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property until paid and shall be prima 
facie evidence of the recitals therein and of its validity. &nbsp;No clerical error or informality in 
the 
taxbill or in the proceedings leading up to the issuance of the taxbill shall be a defense in an 
action to collect the taxbill. &nbsp;Taxbills issued under this section, if not paid when due, shall 
bear 
interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The cost of abatement shall also constitute a personal 
obligation of the owner of the 
property and of any other person who caused the nuisance.</div>
