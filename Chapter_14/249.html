<p class=texthead>Section 14-249 Vehicle entering yield intersections.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in 
obedience to such sign, slow down to 
a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle or 
cycle in the intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an 
immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection; 
provided, however, that if such a driver is involved in a collision with a vehicle or cycle in the 
intersection, after driving past a yield sign without stopping, such collision shall be deemed 
prima facie evidence of his failure to yield right-of-way. The word &quot;cycle,&quot; as used in this 
division, shall be defined as in section 14-491.</div>
