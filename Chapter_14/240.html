<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Rules generally.</i> The following rules shall govern the overtaking and passing of vehicles 
proceeding in the same direction, subject to the limitations and exceptions hereinafter stated:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An operator or driver overtaking 
and desiring to pass a vehicle or cycle shall sound the 
horn before starting to pass, except in such places where prohibited by ordinance.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of a vehicle overtaking 
another vehicle or cycle proceeding in the same 
direction shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side 
of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except when overtaking and passing 
on the right is permitted, the driver of an overtaken 
vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle or cycle on audible signal 
and shall not increase the speed of his vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except when a roadway has been 
divided into three (3) traffic lanes, no vehicle shall be 
driven to the left side of the centerline of a highway or public road in overtaking and passing 
other vehicles or cycles proceeding in the same direction, unless such left side is clearly visible 
and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and 
passing to be completely made without interference with the safe operation of any vehicle 
approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle or cycle overtaken.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) When permitted. The driver of a motor vehicle may overtake 
and pass to the right of 
another vehicle only under the following conditions:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vehicle or cycle overtaken 
is making or about to make a left turn.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a street with unobstructed 
pavement of sufficient width for two (2) or more lines of 
traffic in each direction.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a one-way street.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of a motor vehicle may 
overtake and pass another vehicle on the right only under 
the foregoing conditions when such movement may be made in safety. In no event shall such 
movement be made by driving off of the paved or main-traveled portion of the roadway.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this subsection shall not relieve the driver 
of a slow moving vehicle from the 
duty to drive as closely as practicable to the right-hand edge of the roadway.</div>
