<p class=texthead>Section 14-311 Hearing on impoundment.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registered owner or any person 
with an interest in a vehicle impounded for unpaid 
parking tickets may request the municipal court to conduct a hearing to contest the validity of the 
impoundment. The request must be in writing and must state the grounds upon which the person 
requesting the hearing believes the impoundment is invalid or unjustified. &nbsp;Except for good 
cause, the request for hearing must be filed within thirty (30) days after the vehicle was 
impounded.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vehicle has been redeemed, 
the municipal judge shall set a hearing on the validity 
of the impoundment within thirty (30) days of receipt of a proper request filed under subsection 
(a). &nbsp;If the vehicle remains impounded, the municipal judge shall set and conduct a hearing 
within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of the request, not including weekends or city holidays, 
unless the person requesting a hearing, for good cause, requests a later hearing date.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the municipal judge finds that 
the impoundment of the vehicle was invalid or 
unjustified, the judge shall order the vehicle to be released immediately and the city shall pay the 
towing charges and storage charges up to the date of the hearing. &nbsp;If these charges have already 
been paid, the city shall reimburse the person who paid them.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the municipal judge finds that 
the impoundment of the vehicle was valid and justified, 
the vehicle, if still impounded, shall remain impounded until redeemed pursuant to Sec. 14-310 
or sold pursuant to state law.</div>
