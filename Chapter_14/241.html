<p class=texthead>Section 14-241 Two or more lanes of traffic.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any roadway has been divided into three (3) or more 
clearly marked lanes for 
traffic, or whenever any one-way street or roadway has been divided into two (2) or more clearly 
marked lanes for traffic, the following rules, in addition to all others consistent herewith, shall 
apply:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vehicle shall be driven as nearly 
as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall 
not be moved from such lane until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be 
made with safety.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a roadway which is divided 
into three (3) lanes, a vehicle shall not be driven in the 
center lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle or cycle when the roadway 
ahead is clearly visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in 
preparation for a left turn where such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic 
moving in the direction in which the vehicle is proceeding and there is a sign posted to give 
notice of such allocation.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon all highways any vehicle 
proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic thereon 
shall be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the right-hand edge 
or curb, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official signs may be erected 
or the city traffic engineer may place temporary signs 
directing slow moving traffic to use a designated lane or allocating a specified lane to traffic 
moving in the same direction. The drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of every such 
sign.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers of vehicles proceeding 
in opposite directions shall pass each other to the right, 
and except when a roadway has been divided into traffic lanes, each driver shall give to the other 
at least one-half of the main traveled portion of the roadway whenever possible.</div>
