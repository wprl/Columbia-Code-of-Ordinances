<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
The purpose of this section is to promote public safety at intersections controlled by 
automated traffic control signals. &nbsp;A violation of this section will be an infraction and civil 
in 
nature with limited sanctions consisting of fines only which are punitive in order to garner 
compliance with the city&#146;s traffic regulations. &nbsp;No points are to be assessed upon a conviction 
of 
this ordinance, nor will jail time be a consideration of punishment. &nbsp;This is a strict liability 
offense and no regard is given as to the offender&#146;s state of mind at the time of the violation.</span></div>

Liability for a violation of this section is based on ownership of the vehicle without regard

claiming the exception under section 304.120.4 RSMo., the owner must furnish the name,

time of the violation within thirty (30) days from the time of receipt of written request for such

<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violation. &nbsp;Except as provided 
in this section, a person commits the infraction of this 
public safety ordinance when a motor vehicle of which that person is the registered owner is 
present in an intersection while the traffic control signal for the intersection is emitting a steady 
red signal for the direction of travel or orientation of that vehicle in or through the intersection, 
unless the motor vehicle is in the process of making a lawful turn, or unless the motor vehicle 
entered the intersection while the traffic control signal for the intersection was not emitting a 
steady red signal for the direction of travel or orientation of that vehicle in or through the 
intersection and the motor vehicle did not obstruct the passage of other motor vehicles or 
pedestrians. </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalty. &nbsp;The penalty 
for a violation of this infraction shall not exceed two hundred 
($200.00) dollars. The judge of the municipal court shall set the fine amount upon the court&#146;s 
Violations Bureau schedule. &nbsp;Additionally, as operation is not an element in the violation of this 
section, no report to the Missouri Department of Revenue is authorized as the violation is 
deemed a non-moving violation. &nbsp;Under no circumstances may a person be imprisoned for a 
violation of this section; however, nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the judge&#146;s 
authority for contempt.</div>
