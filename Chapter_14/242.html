<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle 
or cycle more closely than is 
reasonably safe and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle or cycle and the 
traffic upon and the condition of the roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside 
of a business or residential district in a caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other 
vehicles, shall be so operated, except in a funeral procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as 
to allow sufficient space between each such vehicle or combination of vehicles to enable any 
other vehicle or cycle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety.</div>
