<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) No vehicle operated upon the streets of this city shall 
have a width, including load, in 
excess of ninety-six (96) inches, except clearance lights, rearview mirrors or other accessories 
required by federal, state or city law or regulation.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) No vehicle operated upon the highways of this city shall 
have a height, including load, in 
excess of thirteen and one-half (13 1/2) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) No single motor vehicle operated upon the highways of 
this city shall have a length, 
including load, in excess of forty (40) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) No bus or trackless trolley coach operated upon the streets 
of this city shall have a length 
in excess of fifty-six (56) feet; provided, however, such vehicles may exceed the fifty-six (56) 
feet length when such excess length is caused by the projection of a front safety bumper or a rear 
safety bumper or both. Such safety bumper shall not cause the length of the bus to exceed the 
fifty-six (56) feet length limit by more than one foot in the front and one foot in the rear. The 
term &quot;safety bumper&quot; means any device which may be fitted on an existing bumper or which 
replaces the bumper and is so constructed, treated, or manufactured so that it absorbs energy 
upon impact.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) No combination of truck-tractor and semitrailer operated 
upon the highways of this state 
shall have a length, including load, in excess of sixty (60) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Except as hereinafter provided, these restrictions shall 
not apply to agricultural implements 
operating occasionally on the streets for short distances, or to self-propelled hay-hauling 
equipment, or to implements of husbandry, or to vehicles temporarily transporting agricultural 
implements or implements of husbandry or road-making machinery, or road materials, or towing 
for repair purposes vehicles that have become disabled upon the streets, or to implement dealers 
delivering or moving farm machinery for repairs on any streets other than the interstate system. 
Implements of husbandry and vehicles transporting such machinery or equipment may be 
operated occasionally for short distances on streets when operated between the hours of sunrise 
and sunset by a driver licensed as an operator or chauffeur. As used in this paragraph the term 
&quot;implements of husbandry&quot; means all self-propelled machinery operated at speeds of less than 
thirty (30) miles per hour, specifically designed for, or especially adapted to be capable of, 
incidental over-the-road and primary off-road usage and used exclusively for the application of 
commercial plant food materials or agricultural chemicals, and not specifically designed or 
intended for transportation of such chemicals and materials. No implement of husbandry may 
exceed a width of eleven (11) feet, six (6) inches. The purpose of this section is to permit a single 
trip per day by the implement of husbandry from the source of supply to a given farm.</div>
