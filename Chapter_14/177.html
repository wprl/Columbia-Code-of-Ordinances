<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Whenever the director of public works shall find that 
any city road or bridge of such city is 
in such a condition that use thereof by vehicles of the weights specified in Section 304.180, 
RSMo., 1969, will endanger the road or bridge, or the users thereof, he may with the approval of 
the city manager establish maximum weight limits for vehicles using such road or bridge in such 
amounts as will preserve the road or bridge and provide a reasonable margin of safety to the 
users thereof. Notice of any such weight limit established shall be given by posting signs at 
convenient and public places along any such road, and in conspicuous places at each end of any 
such bridge.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a vehicle 
of a weight in excess of the 
maximum limit established pursuant to the provisions of this chapter on or over any road or 
bridge upon which such maximum weight limits have been established unless he shall have the 
express permission of the officer employed to establish such limit. Any person who shall violate 
the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable in a civil action 
for any damages to the road or bridge.</div>
