<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No provisions of this chapter for which official traffic 
control devices are required shall be 
enforced against an alleged violator if, at the time and place of the alleged violation, an official 
device is not in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant 
person. Whenever a particular section does not state that official traffic control devices are 
required, such section shall be effective even though no devices are erected or in place.</div>
