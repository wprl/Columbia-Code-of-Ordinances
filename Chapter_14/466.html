<p class=texthead>Section 14-466 Traffic control signal legend.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals 
exhibiting different colored lights, or 
colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red 
and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and such 
lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Green indication:</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicular 
traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn 
right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic including 
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians 
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicular 
traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with 
another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by 
such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. 
Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent 
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless 
otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 14-470, 
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may 
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Steady yellow indication:</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicular 
traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green 
movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter 
when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedestrians 
facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian 
control signal as provided in section 14-470, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to 
cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the 
roadway.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Steady red indication:</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicular 
traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the 
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection 
and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown except as provided in subsection (3)b. 
of this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver 
of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the 
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection 
in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn but shall 
yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the 
intersection, except that the state highway commission with reference to an intersection 
involving a state highway, and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other 
highways under their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any 
intersection where safety conditions so require. Such prohibition shall be effective when a sign is 
erected at such intersection giving notice thereof</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless 
otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 14-470, 
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Application.</i> In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a 
place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to 
those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made 
at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence 
of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.</span></div>
