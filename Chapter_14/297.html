<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Angle parked vehicles.</i> A vehicle parked at an angle to the curb on any street in the city 
shall be backed out at that angle until it has cleared other parked vehicles. The driver of such 
vehicle shall then proceed in the direction in which he is most nearly headed, provided that no 
vehicle shall be moved from such parked position unless such movement can be made with 
reasonable safety and without interfering with other traffic upon such street. The driver moving a 
vehicle from such parked position shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles which are in motion 
upon such street.</span></div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Parallel parked vehicles.</i> The driver of a vehicle parked parallel to the curb shall not move 
such vehicle from such parked position unless such movement can be made with reasonable 
safety and without interfering with other traffic upon such street. A driver moving a vehicle from 
such parked position shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles which are in motion on such 
street.</span></div>
