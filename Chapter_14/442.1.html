hereby authorized to meet and confer with the requesting party to determine the exact location 
and number of disabled parking spaces desired.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The traffic engineer shall thereafter post the agreed 
upon disabled spaces with legally 
adequate signs and shall further mark the spaces so that the posting and marking conforms to the 
requirements of law.</div>
