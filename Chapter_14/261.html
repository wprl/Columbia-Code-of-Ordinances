that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the centerline thereof, and by passing to the 
right of such centerline where it enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left

being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection 
to the left of the center of the intersection.</span></div>

intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to 
traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle and after entering the intersection the left 
turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane 
lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction upon the roadway being entered.</span></div>
