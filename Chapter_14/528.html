as a passenger, any motorcycle, motor 
scooter or motor bike upon any public street, alley, or other thoroughfare, or in any public park 
within the city unless such person, while riding, is wearing a safety helmet or headgear with a 
chin strap affixed thereto and securely fastened beneath the chin. The minimum protective 
standards for such safety helmet or headgear shall be determined by the director of traffic. In 
determining such minimum protective standards for such safety helmets or headgear, such 
director may use the American Standards Association specifications for protective headgear for 
vehicular users, as approved by the American Standards Association, now in effect, or as 
hereafter amended by such association. Such minimum protective standard specifications shall be 
currently maintained by such director and made available at all times for public inspection.</div>
