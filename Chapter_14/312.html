<p class=texthead>Section 14-312 Immobilization of vehicles for unpaid parking tickets.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vehicle may be immobilized by means 
of a mechanical boot if there are four (4) or 
more parking tickets issued against the vehicle that remain unpaid more than fifteen (15) days 
after issuance or, in the case of a contested ticket, after the vehicle has been finally adjudged to 
have been illegally parked. &nbsp;A &#147;mechanical boot&#148; is a device that can be attached to 
the wheel of 
a motor vehicle to prevent it from being driven.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immobilization by means of a mechanical 
boot shall be limited as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immobilization shall not exceed twenty-four 
(24) hours, except that a police officer may 
reduce the period because of safety or traffic considerations.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No vehicle shall be immobilized unless 
the vehicle is found on a public street or public 
parking lot.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No vehicle shall be immobilized within 
the traveled portion of any street or portion of 
any street or sidewalk when the immobilization would create a hazard.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the registered owner or operator 
of the vehicle fails to pay the outstanding parking 
tickets or fails to post a cash or surety bond for all unresolved parking tickets within twenty-four 
(24) hours, the city may have the vehicle towed to a place of impoundment.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a vehicle has been immobilized 
by means of a mechanical boot, a notice shall 
be placed on the vehicle stating the time and date the immobilization device was placed on the 
vehicle, and briefly describing the means of securing removal of the mechanical boot within the 
twenty-four (24) hour period.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registered owner or operator 
of an immobilized vehicle may secure removal of the 
mechanical boot within the twenty-four (24) hour period either by payment of all outstanding 
parking tickets or by posting a cash or surety bond for all unresolved parking tickets.</div>
