<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any ordinance of the city designates and describes 
a through street, it shall be the 
duty of the city traffic engineer to place and maintain a stop sign, or on the basis of any 
engineering and traffic investigation, at any intersection, a yield sign, on each and every street 
intersection of such through street unless traffic at any such intersection is controlled at all times 
by traffic control signals; provided, however, that at the intersection of two (2) such through 
streets or at the intersection of a through street and a heavy traffic street not so designated, stop 
signs shall be erected at the approaches of either or both of such streets, as may be determined by 
the city traffic engineer, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic study.</div>
