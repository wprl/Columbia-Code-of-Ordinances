&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of public works may designate a curb loading zone in a parking 
meter zone upon 
the request of any persons or entities who make application for such zone. Such application shall 
be in writing and shall be accompanied by a fee of five hundred twenty dollars ($520.00) per 
parking space per annum (or monthly proration thereof). The director of public works, upon 
designating a zone pursuant to an application, may, by general regulations, impose conditions 
upon the use of such zone. Every such designation shall expire on December 31 of the year 
issued. The director of public works shall keep a permanent record of all current zones 
designated under this section. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to confer upon any 
applicant an exclusive right to use a loading zone designated pursuant to this section.</span></font></div>
