<p>
<body>
<div align=left>(a) &nbsp;The CASH program is established to assist eligible senior citizens and disabled 
persons in 
paying utility bills and to assist eligible senior citizens in making utility related emergency home 
repairs.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City utility customers may specify amounts they wish to contribute 
to the CASH program 
and have such amounts charged on their utility bills. &nbsp;Contributions to the CASH program shall 
be accounted for separately.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be eligible to receive assistance as a senior citizen, 
an individual must be a least 60 years 
old. &nbsp;To be eligible to receive assistance as a disabled person, an individual either must be 
currently receiving income based on disability status (for example social security disability 
payments) or must be totally unable to work because of a physical or mental impairment as 
documented by a health care professional.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual must meet the following guidelines to be eligible 
to receive assistance under 
the CASH program:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual must be a City electric 
utility customer and the utility account must be in 
the individual&#146;s name.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual&#146;s household income 
must be at or below 150% of the federal 
government&#146;s poverty guidelines.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual&#146;s other resources 
must be exhausted.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance in paying utility bills is subject to the following 
limitations:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual seeking assistance 
must be without utility service or the individual&#146;s 
utility service must be due for disconnection.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments may be made only for electric, 
water, sewer or utility deposit. Payments for 
utility deposits shall be made no more than one (1) time per household and shall be for a 
maximum of seventy-five dollars ($75.00). Payments shall not be made for fees of any kind 
including disconnection fees and reconnection fees.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than six hundred dollars 
($600.00) shall be paid in assistance for any individual 
in any twelve (12) month period.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disabled individuals are only eligible 
for the amount of assistance needed to avoid 
disconnection, for reconnection or for a deposit. &nbsp;Senior citizens may apply for the annual 
maximum amount regardless of their account status.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determinations of eligibility and the amount of assistance 
to be granted to applicants shall
