<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city will install and maintain 
the radio-control device.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written authorization will be provided 
by the customer (by the owner for rental 
property) permitting the city to install, maintain, and operate the switch device.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air-conditioner or heat pump 
is maintained by the customer and in a manner such 
that it operates at its highest efficiency.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shall have the authority 
to discontinue the discount at any time that the customer 
violates any provision of this section, and shall not restore the discount until the violation is 
corrected.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the customer receiving load control 
service is not satisfied with the service, the 
customer may request that the city remove the load control switch at which time the discount 
shall also be terminated.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discount shall be applied for 
service rendered to any premises after the written 
authority is received and shall continue thereafter even though the premises are sold or the 
occupant changes until such time as the current occupant or owner requests that the service be 
terminated.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If more 
than twenty-five (25) per cent of the air-conditioning load is supplied by 
equipment that does not allow the installation of a load control device, participation in this 
program and amount of discount shall be determined by the director or the director's designee.</div>
