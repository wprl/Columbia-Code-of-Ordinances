<p class=texthead>Section 27-168 Loan committee.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager is hereby authorized 
to appoint representatives of the water and light 
and finance departments to administer the program. All loans shall be made based upon the 
following principles:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program shall be conducted 
at all times based upon sound business principles and 
shall in no way be deemed a welfare or social service program of the city. No loan shall be made 
without having first ascertained the credit worthiness of the loan applicant and without having 
obtained adequate security for any loan.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having established the credit 
worthiness of the applicant, the committee shall make 
its loans in such a manner to reduce, by the greatest amount possible, the consumption of electric 
energy within the city. This goal shall be attained by consideration of:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total 
energy consumption of the applicant; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results 
of an energy audit made to determine the potential impact of a loan under 
the program, along with the ability of that loan to reduce the electric consumption of the 
applicant.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No applicant shall be refused 
a loan because of sex, race, religion, place of national 
origin, marital status, age, sexual orientation, handicap, political affiliation or ancestry.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of water and light 
is hereby authorized to develop application forms for use 
in the program.</div>
