system.</div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permanent facility will utilize 
a service at the same phase and voltage as the 
temporary service.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All poles, wires, cables, transformers 
or other appurtenances utilized or installed, except

than that will be utilized permanently, temporary service requiring more than 100 amperes, single 
phase, or temporary service requiring the installation of any poles or wires, or other electrical 
distribution material or apparatus which will not be utilized permanently, shall be available only 
if the customer requesting such service assumes all costs incurred by the department in installing 
and removing such service, including the cost of labor, material not salvaged, engineering, 
supervision and overhead. The customer shall furnish and install the temporary service pole, or 
other approved support, for attachment of the service drop. The customer shall furnish and install

public street or alley, the pole shall consist of a treated 
pine, or equivalent, pole having a circumference at the top of fifteen (15) inches or more and of 
sufficient length to provide eighteen (18) feet of clearance above the street or alley surface. The 
pole shall be placed a minimum of four and one-half (4-1/2) feet into the ground and braced or 
guyed to withstand one thousand five hundred (1500) pounds of horizontal pull at the top in the 
direction of the service drop.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Temporary electric service equipment, temporary poles, 
etc., shall be placed on the lot 
where the permanent structure is to be located and shall be located in an area that is accessible
