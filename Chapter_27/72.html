<p class=texthead>Section 27-72 Extension of water (trunk) mains by department.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As stipulated in section 27-71 above, distribution water 
mains are extended at the expense 
of parties other than the department; however, in order to provide a complete adequate water 
distribution system to all areas of the city, the department has installed and extended, and may 
continue to install and extend, water mains, generally called trunk mains, within the city limits 
under any of the following conditions:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through an undeveloped area to 
bring service to a developed or developing area.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide an increase in water 
volume and pressure to a developed area.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close loops in the distribution 
system to provide circulation and increased volume.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To connect and bring service to 
a water distribution system other than the city's for the 
purpose of taking over or acquiring such system.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of replacing, 
to bring up to city standards, water mains which are 
acquired from others.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other reason which, in the 
opinion of the director, is essential to providing adequate 
service to an area of the city, yet is not an immediate benefit to the properties adjoining the water 
main.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The director shall determine the priority of need and 
the location of water mains to be 
installed by the department. Such determination shall consider the actual needs of the area to be 
served as well as the availability of funds. First priorities shall be given to developed areas which 
have service that may be inadequate under given conditions.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) When a customer requests a connection which, in the opinion 
of the director, can be made 
from a trunk main or other main which has been installed at the sole expense of the department, 
such customer shall pay to the city a proportional share of the cost of the water main according to 
the following formulas:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For connections two (2) inches 
or smaller: The number of feet of water main fronting on 
or otherwise bordering the lot or tract being served multiplied by the department's latest 
estimated per foot cost of installed six-inch water main of the same material as the main to which 
the service line is being connected.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For connections larger than two 
(2) inches: The number of feet of water main fronting on 
or otherwise bordering the lot or tract being served multiplied by the department's latest 
estimated per foot cost of installed water main of the same size and material as the main to which 
the connection is being made. In no event shall the customer's cost be less than the department's 
latest estimated per foot cost for installed six-inch main of the same material nor more than the 
department's latest estimated per foot cost for installed water main of the size determined by the 
director as necessary to provide adequate fire protection and service to the area.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For connections one inch or smaller 
to homesteads, farmsteads or recreational property 
with frontages or other abutting dimensions greater than two hundred (200) feet, the property 
owner shall, as consideration for such connection:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay an 
amount equal to the actual cost (at the date of such request) of one hundred 
(100) feet of six-inch water main; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agreement 
in a form approved by the city counselor obligating all of the owners of a 
real property interest in the tract to pay the balance of the actual cost of a six-inch main across 
the tract at the date future services are requested or the tract is developed for residential or 
commercial uses.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The department shall review and update its estimates 
at least once a year, using the latest 
available costs of pipe, labor and equipment and shall base the number of hours required on 
actual installations of a comparative type, which have been made in the recent past.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) When it is apparent that a city installed water main 
can serve customers on both sides of 
the right-of-way, only one-half of the above charge shall be assessed to any customer. Where 
customers' properties front on highway rights-of-way or other rights-of-way where the 
controlling authority will not permit service crossings, the full estimated cost of the main shall be 
assessed to any customer.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The monies received as payment for water mains, as herein 
provided, shall be placed in the 
extension, improvement, enlargement and betterment fund established by the city charter, and 
shall be expended only for the purpose of installing and constructing additional water main 
extensions.</div>
