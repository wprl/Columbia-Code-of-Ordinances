<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
At the discretion of the finance director, the security deposit may be waived upon the customer 
establishing one (1) year (twelve consecutive months) good credit or furnishing a letter of good 
credit from the customer&#146;s previous utility provider. &nbsp;The finance director will maintain 
a written 
policy that defines good credit.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more than one of the above 
services is requested, the amount of the deposit shall 
be the total amount of the fees shown for the services requested. The finance director may also 
increase security deposits for residential accounts to minimize the city's risks where appropriate.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A residential landlord requesting services for a rental unit 
shall make a security deposit 
based on the number of rental units for which the landlord has utility security deposits with the 
city:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First 25 units . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$10.00 per unit</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units in excess of 25 . . . . . . . . . . $5.00 per unit</div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The maximum amount of security deposits a residential landlord shall be required to make, 
regardless of the number of rental units, is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). At the discretion of 
the finance director, the customer may request the deposit be waived upon the customer 
establishing one (1) year (twelve consecutive months) good credit with the City of Columbia. 
The finance director will maintain a written policy that defines good credit.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In order for customers to obtain service to a commercial 
establishment or for any use other 
than single-family residential use, they shall be required to meet one of the following provisions:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
Make a deposit based on twice the estimated amount of thirty (30) days' bill for those 
services requested for new accounts, and be adjusted to twice the actual average as necessary. 
The finance director may also increase security deposits for commercial accounts to minimize the 
city's risks where appropriate.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furnish equivalent bond or letter 
of credit.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>At the discretion of the finance director, commercial security deposits may be waived 
upon the 
commercial customer having established a minimum of three (3) years' continuous timely 
payments.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Service deposits may be transferred or applied to a new 
residence or business location if a 
customer moves. Adjustment shall be made if the amount of deposit is inadequate or excessive.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department may require an additional security 
deposit as a condition of continued 
service if, in an unauthorized manner, the customer interferes with or diverts the service of the 
utility situated on or about or delivered to the customer's premises. &nbsp;The department may require 
a signed application for service and additional security deposit from any customer giving false 
information to access City of Columbia utility services.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) No additional security deposit shall be required by the 
department on the basis of the 
customer's age, sex, race, creed, national origin, marital status, number of dependents, source of 
income, or geographical area of residence.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Upon termination of service, the deposit shall be credited 
to the final bill and the balance, 
if any, shall be returned to the customer.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the discretion of the finance director, the security 
deposit may be waived upon the 
customer establishing one (1) year (twelve consecutive months) good credit or furnishing a letter 
of good credit from the customer&#146;s previous utility provider. &nbsp;The finance director will maintain 
a 
written policy that defines good credit. Should the deposit be credited to a customer's account 
and the customer's services discontinued subsequently due to nonpayment, the customer will be 
required to make the proper security deposits in addition to other charges and fees as a requisite 
for resumption of services.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The department shall maintain a record of all deposits 
received from customers, showing 
the name of each customer, the location of the premises occupied by the customer at the time the 
deposit was required and each successive location while the deposit is retained, and the date and 
amount of deposit.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) Each customer posting a security deposit shall 
receive in writing at the time of tender of 
deposit receipts as evidence thereof, which, where applicable, contains the following minimum 
information:</div>
<br>

<br>
<div align=justify>In addition, each customer shall sign a service agreement which states the terms 
and conditions 
governing the retention, payment and return of deposits.</div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) The department shall apply deposit standards uniformly 
as a condition of utility service to 
all customers.</div>
