&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;The department shall not furnish and install fire hydrants except 
to replace or relocate 
existing obsolete units or on new water mains installed by the department. &nbsp;Fire hydrants shall 
be 
furnished and installed as prescribed in division 3 in the same manner as other material used for 
water main extensions and shall be sized, located and constructed in accordance with the 
regulations, specifications and requirements of the department and under the inspection and 
direction of the director.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;The department shall be responsible for supplying water in adequate 
pressures and flows 
for fire protection purposes, everywhere within the city that water mains have been installed by 
the department or accepted for ownership by the council. The minimum flows for fire protection 
in single-family residential areas shall be eight hundred (800) gallons per minute for four (4) 
hours with a minimum system residual pressure of twenty (20) pounds per square inch. The 
minimum flow for fire protection in all other areas shall be determined by the fire chief or his 
designee using tactical formulas developed by the National Fire Academy or any other 
organization with expertise in firefighting techniques. The minimum flow for fire protection 
based on a tactical formula may be reduced by the fire chief or his designee following a thorough 
risk evaluation but shall be at least eighty (80) per cent of the Insurance Services Office (ISO) 
needed fire flow. If a risk evaluation for certain property results in a needed fire flow exceeding 
three thousand five hundred (3,500) gallons per minute, the property owner, as a condition to 
receiving a building permit, may be required to provide facilities to meet the fire flow 
requirement or participate in the cost of city water system improvements needed to meet the fire 
flow standards.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Hydrants may be installed by property owners or other interested parties 
outside the city 
limits on water mains distributing city water by approval of the director and in compliance with 
department specifications and under department inspection. Upon satisfactory inspection of the 
hydrant or council acceptance of the water main extension complete with hydrants, the fire 
hydrants shall become and remain the property of the city, in consideration of the perpetual 
upkeep and maintenance.</span></font></div>
