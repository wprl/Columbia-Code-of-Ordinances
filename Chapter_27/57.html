<p class=texthead>Section 27-57 Cross connections.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Cross-connections includeany physical connection between 
a potable water supply and any 
waste pipe, soil pipe, sewer, drain, or any unapproved source or system. &nbsp;Cross-connections 
include any potable water supply outlet which is submerged or can be submerged in waste water 
or any other source of contamination and any source or system that is, in the opinion of the 
director, based on the standards of the Missouri Division of Health, nonpotable, and through 
which backflow can occur to contaminate the department's system. Cross-connections include 
bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover devices, 
and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow can 
occur. &nbsp;Cross-connections may be &nbsp;direct or indirect. A &nbsp;cross-connection is direct when &nbsp;the 
department's water system is physically joined to a system containing unsafe water, sewage, or 
other waste that could contaminate the safe water system. A cross-connection is indirect when &nbsp;a 
source of contaminated water may be blown across, sucked, or diverted into the department's 
system.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Unprotected cross-connections in the customer's water installation 
are not permitted. If an 
unprotected cross-connection is discovered, the department, after giving the customer no less 
than fifteen (15) days' notice of its intention, will discontinue service, unless the condition is 
corrected or an approved backflow prevention device is installed by and at the expense of the 
customer. If, in the opinion of the director, a real and serious threat to public health is posed, the 
department may discontinue service without notice.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Service connections will not be made nor allowed to continue 
where there is, in the opinion 
of the director, a strong potential for hazardous cross-connections, unless the customer will 
install and maintain, at the customer&#146;s &nbsp;expense, a backflow prevention device approved by 
the 
department.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those facilities classified as actual 
or potential Class I backflow hazards (by the 
Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the Director of Public Works or the Director of 
Water and Light Department) shall be equipped, at a minimum, with an air gap separation or 
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. &nbsp;Those facilities classified as actual 
or 
potential Class II backflow hazards shall be equipped, at a minimum, with a double-check valve 
assembly.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director, at his discretion, may require a device at other 
facilities dangerous to public 
health.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Backflow prevention devices shall be approved by the director 
before installation by the 
customer and shall have been certified by a recognized testing laboratory acceptable to the 
director. Installation and initial testing shall be approved by the department.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The customer shall install and maintain all backflow prevention 
devices in good working 
order and to make no piping or other arrangements for bypassing the devices. &nbsp;The customer shall 
permit access to the premises by the certified backflow prevention assembly tester, supplier of 
water and DNR representatives, at reasonable times and upon presentation of identification, for 
inspection of the customer water system or testing of backflow prevention assemblies installed in 
accordance with this ordinance.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Periodic testing and inspection schedules shall be established 
by the department for all 
backflow prevention devices. Inspection intervals will not exceed the minimum requirements set 
out in the Rules of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. &nbsp;As a courtesy only, the 
Department may send a reminder notice to customers with known backflow prevention devices.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) It shall be the responsibility of the customer to have each 
assembly inspected and tested by 
a properly certified and listed tester at the time of construction or installation and each year 
thereafter, no later than thirty (30) days after the anniversary of the original inspection test date. 
Backflow prevention assembly testers shall be certified through a Department of Natural 
Resource approved program and be listed with the department.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Testers shall report to the supplier of water and the customer 
the results of inspections or 
tests conducted in compliance with applicable state regulations. &nbsp;Reports of tests shall contain 
the 
signature of the certified tester, attesting to the compliance or noncompliance of the assembly 
with established operational requirements. &nbsp;Reports shall be submitted to the department within 
thirty (30) days after performing the inspection or test.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) Testing, inspection, and overhaul of devices may &nbsp;be 
performed by department personnel 
when it is deemed in the interest of the department and other customers. &nbsp;The device owner will 
be charged not less than the actual cost for the testing and inspection, plus any cost for 
replacement or repair parts and other materials.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) A violation of any part of this section may cause the 
customer&#146;s water supply to be 
disconnected by the department.</div>
