<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The ordinance referred to in section 27-73 above shall 
provide that after the publication 
thereof, the owners of the property affected by the improvement shall have thirty (30) days from 
the date of the publication to make and complete the improvement provided for in the ordinance 
under the direction of the director of the water and light department and in conformity with the 
plans and specifications filed as provided for in section 27-73. At the end of such thirty (30) 
days, the owners of the land affected by the improvement shall cease to have a right to make the 
improvement by private contract and the council shall have the power to cause a contract for 
such work to be let to the lowest and best bidder on the plans and specifications filed as aforesaid 
with the city clerk by the director of the water and light department, not less than one week's 
advertisement for bids thereon being made in some newspaper published in the city.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the event there are no bids received, that bids are 
above estimates, or all bids are 
rejected for any reason, the city council may order the city clerk to advertise for bids as in the 
first instance, or may, by ordinance, order and require the city official charged with the 
responsibility for such improvement under the charter to perform such work, using the city's own 
departments and employees, in accordance with the plans and specifications adopted therefor and 
the conditions of the charter and this article. Such city official shall keep an accurate account of 
the cost of the separate items thereof, and the city shall pay for the labor and material and all 
other costs of such work out of any funds which they may have on hand available for such 
purpose; and at the completion of such work, either by contract or by the city as last provided, 
shall provide for payment therefor as set forth in the charter, this article and other ordinances 
governing public improvements.</div>
