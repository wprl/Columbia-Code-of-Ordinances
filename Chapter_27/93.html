<p class=texthead>Section 27-93 Underground service.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Underground services are required in all new residential 
subdivisions, except that where 
poles and overhead lines have previously been installed or are required for reasons permitted by 
this Code, the service may be provided by the use of a service drop.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Underground residential services shall be installed by 
the department at no cost to the 
person or parties requesting the service, except that when rock excavation or other extreme 
conditions create costs in excess of normal installation costs, as established by the department 
records, the department may require the person or parties requesting the service to pay that 
portion of the costs which are in excess of a normal installation.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) All underground services, except residential underground 
services, , shall be made in the 
same manner and under the same terms and conditions as an extension to the distribution system. 
(See section 27-88.)</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Underground services shall terminate in a junction box, 
meter socket or other enclosure 
located outside of the building or facility being served. The location of this enclosure shall be as 
designated and/or approved by the director. It shall be the customer's responsibility to extend his 
service entrance from this enclosure.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Any residential customer may request the department to 
extend the underground service 
beyond the approved and designated termination point. (See paragraph (d) of this section.) Upon 
receipt of such request, the department shall make such extension under the following 
conditions:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The installation shall be made 
in complete compliance with the standards, specifications 
and construction requirements of the department.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junction box, meter socket 
or other enclosure shall be located on the load end of the 
underground service and such location shall remain on the outside of the building.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service line extension shall 
be made at the same time that the normal service is 
installed.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customer shall pay the department 
for the actual cost of the additional service line, 
as established by the department.</div>
