<p class=texthead>Section 27-53 Same--Location.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The location of the water service line, in relation to 
the water main and the property to be 
served, shall be determined by the department.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A permanent meter box shall be installed at the customer's 
property line in a location 
determined by the department. The meter box shall be installed to match the existing land 
surface, unless the customer submits a written description or plan of proposed relandscaping to 
the department.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) When it is impractical to install the meter box at the 
property line, as determined by the 
director, the water meter may be installed indoors or elsewhere on the property to be served, 
provided it is protected from damage or freezing and, when located indoors, is readily accessible 
in an unlocked room or enclosure. If a meter becomes inaccessible, in the option of the 
department, the customer must make provision for its relocation or for a remote reading device. 
Regardless of its location, the customer shall be responsible for damage to the meter or its 
appurtenances, caused by the customer's negligence or failure to properly safeguard and protect 
such meter and appurtenances from hazards.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The department reserves the right to relocate the water 
service line or any appurtenance 
thereof, at its own expense. If the customer desires relocation, or a change in elevation, of the 
water service line or any appurtenances thereof, he shall make written request to the department 
and deposit the estimated cost for labor, equipment and material, plus overhead, to complete this 
relocation or change with the department. In the event of an underestimate, the customer will be 
billed for the remainder; in the event of an overestimate, the excess will be refunded.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) If the customer should relandscape his property, making 
it difficult to read the meter, the 
department may relocate or change the elevation of the meter and meter box and charge the 
customer the actual cost of labor, equipment and material, plus overhead therefor.</div>
