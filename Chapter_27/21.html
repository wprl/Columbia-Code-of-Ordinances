&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) Failure of the customer to enter into negotiation with the department to 
resolve a dispute or 
enter into a settlement agreement shall constitute a waiver of the customer's right to continuance 
of service and the city may then proceed to discontinue service as provided.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

discontinuance of service has been eliminated, applicable restoration charges paid and, if 
required, satisfactory credit arrangements have been made. At all times every effort shall be 
made to restore services upon the day restoration is requested, and in any event restoration shall
