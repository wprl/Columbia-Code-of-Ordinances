<p class=texthead>Section 27-19 Billing and payment.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The city shall render a bill once during each billing 
period to every customer in accordance 
with the applicable rate schedule.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The manner of furnishing the statement shall be as determined 
by the finance director, 
provided each customer is billed in a reasonable, predictable manner.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The city may divide the service area into sections, and/or 
the customers into various classes 
for the purpose of rendering statements. Such sections or classes may be changed from time to 
time to meet the operating requirements of the city. Such sections or classes are for the sole 
purpose of establishing a billing rotation and shall have no affect on the amount or rate of billing.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Each billing statement rendered by the city shall be 
computed on the actual usage during 
the billing period except as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city reserves the right to 
render a bill based on estimated usage for any of, but not 
limited to, the following reasons:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When extreme 
weather conditions, emergencies, or work stoppages prevent actual 
meter readings.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a 
customer fails to provide safe and reasonable access to the customer's premises 
for the purpose of reading the meter.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As provided 
for by the ordinance establishing the service.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should 
the meter be damaged or tampered with in any manner which may render its 
readings inaccurate.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances will the 
city render a bill based on an estimate as a customer's 
initial, or final bill of service.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When issuing an estimated bill, 
the city shall:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain 
accurate records of the reasons therefor and efforts made to secure an actual 
reading.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly 
and conspicuously note on the bill that it is based on estimated usage.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should 
the city underestimate a customer's actual usage, the customer will be given the 
opportunity, if requested, to make payment in installments.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) All service bills shall be due and payable in full twenty 
(20) days from the date the bill was 
mailed, after which they shall be considered delinquent. If the last day for remittance falls upon a 
weekend or holiday, or any other day when the offices of the department, regularly used for the 
payment of customer bills, are not open to the general public, the final payment date shall be 
extended through to the close of the next business day. The date of payment for remittance 
through the mail shall be the date on which the department receives the remittance.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the city 
shall assess late charges against all 
delinquent accounts. &nbsp;If a customer&#146;s bill is not paid in full by the date payment is due, 
the bill 
for the next billing period shall include a late charge equal to 1&#189;% of the amount remaining 
unpaid on the due date of the preceding billing period. &nbsp;Late charges shall not be assessed against 
the balance due on a delinquent account if the customer is current on the payments required by a 
settlement agreement for the account.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Every bill for utility service shall clearly state:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present and previous meter readings 
for water and electric service as well as &quot;service 
date to&quot; and &quot;service date from&quot; and number of service days.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel adjustment factor.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption of water and electric 
services during billing period.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billing date.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water and electric meter numbers.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any previous balance.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of gross receipts and sales 
tax.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date when bill will be considered 
delinquent.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount due for utility charges.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current amount due and total 
bill.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax and rate codes.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The address and/or phone numbers 
where information may be obtained on utility bills.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) The department may include charges for special services 
together with utility charges on 
the same bill if the charges for special services are designated clearly and separately from utility 
charges.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) If partial payment is made, the department shall first 
credit all payments to the balance 
outstanding for utility service.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) Whenever a customer shall order his services terminated 
or otherwise cease to be a 
customer, all amounts owed by the customer to the city shall immediately become due.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) Bills for accounts to which services have been terminated 
or discontinued for a period of 
thirty (30) days shall be considered delinquent thirty (30) days after the final billing date.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>Should the account remain outstanding for a period of sixty (60) days, the account 
will be 
submitted to a collection agency for collection. All such collection costs, as well as any costs 
pertaining to adjudication, will be borne by the debtor.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, through no fault of the residential 
customer, the city fails to initiate billing in a timely 
manner or under-bills the residential customer, the residential customer shall not be billed an 
additional amount for any utility services received more than six (6) months before the current 
billing cycle.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers paying by credit card 
shall be assessed a service fee to be determined by the 
finance director.</div>
