<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city council may provide for the paying of the cost of 
laying and extending water main 
pipes by such city by levying a special assessment, as herein provided, on the lots and tracts of 
land fronting or abutting on either side of the street, avenue or alley along the distance so 
improved in proportion to the front foot, whenever a majority of the resident owners of the 
property liable to taxation therefor and who shall own a majority of the front feet owned by 
residents of the city abutting on the street or alley along which the improvement is to be made, 
shall petition the city council for such improvement; or whenever such body, in its discretion, 
shall deem extension of water mains necessary for sanitary or other purposes conducive to the 
public welfare.</div>
