<p class=texthead>Section 27-71 Extension of distribution water mains, generally.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The extension of distribution water mains may be initiated 
and made in one of the 
following ways:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city council may, by ordinance, 
declare the necessity for and direct the extension of 
water mains as a public improvement, as provided for in chapter 22 of this Code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any individual, group of individuals, 
corporation, association, institution, club or other 
parties desiring to become customers and to purchase water from the department, may upon 
approval of proper application and as otherwise herein provided, extend the city's water mains, 
provided all such extensions shall be wholly within the corporate city limits.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) All applications for permission to make such extension 
shall be submitted in writing to the 
director of the water and light department, who shall approve or disapprove such application. 
The application shall clearly indicate the desired route and approximate length of the extension 
and that the applicant agrees to the following:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To construct the entire extension 
from the end of the existing water main to and across 
the entire frontage or other dimension of the lot or tract to be served, except as otherwise herein 
provided. Such extension shall be of pipe size, as determined by the director, which will provide 
adequate fire protection and service to the area, but in no case shall the pipe size be less than six 
(6) inches. Should the department require a pipe size larger than that required to provide 
adequate fire protection and service to the area, then the department shall pay for the difference 
in cost of such larger size.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To size, locate and construct 
the extension in accordance with the regulations, 
specifications and requirements of the department, and under the inspection and direction of the 
director.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion, and after passing 
final inspection and tests, to transfer ownership of 
the complete water main extension to the city in consideration of its perpetual upkeep and 
maintenance. The department shall not be required to provide service or to perform maintenance 
on such water main extension until after the transfer of ownership has been completed.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assume the cost of the entire 
extension.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicant property owners requesting 
permission to extend water mains for the purpose 
of supplying one inch or smaller water service for a homestead, farmstead or recreational 
property zoned R-1 or A-1 shall:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay for 
the extension of the main to his property line; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay for 
the extension of the main across the frontage or other abutting dimension of his 
tract, unless the frontage or other abutting dimension exceeds two hundred (200) feet, in which 
case the property owner shall bear the costs of extending the main to a point adjacent to where 
service is required but in no event less than one hundred (100) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that an applicant 
property owner does not extend the main across the full lot 
frontage or above abutting dimension under the provisions of subsection (b)(5) herein, all holders 
of an interest in the property shall enter into a written agreement in a form approved by the city 
counselor, prior to such extension, obligating such owners to pay the balance of the cost of 
extension at such time as such extension is required by residential or commercial development of 
the tract or at the date future water services are requested for the subject tract.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) When the city council by ordinance directs the extension 
of water mains as a public 
improvement to be paid for by special tax bills issued to adjoining properties, lots, or tracts 
served by water mains that do not extend entirely across the frontage or other dimensions of such 
property, such property shall be assessed the cost of the extension across the remaining footage, 
at the time of such extension; provided, that if an owner of the property in question has 
previously paid for extension of a water main to provide water service to such property, the water 
main footage for which payment was previously made shall be taken into account in determining 
the amount of the assessment as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>Foot frontage of property minus water main footage for which payment was previously 
made 
equals footage to be assessed.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>The terms and conditions for the sale of water outside the city limits shall be as 
established and 
approved by the council.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(Code 1964, &#167; 15.340)</div>
