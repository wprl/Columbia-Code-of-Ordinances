with contract, the director of 
the water and light department of the city shall compute the cost thereof and apportion such cost 
among the various lots and tracts of land chargeable therewith, charging each lot or tract of land 
with its proportionate part of such cost as required herein, and shall make a written report to the 
council that such improvements be completed in accordance with the contract for the same and 
describe therein the lots and tracts of land chargeable with the part of the cost of such 
improvement and the amount with which it is chargeable and the name of the owner thereof. If 
the council accepts the work and approves the report, they shall, by ordinance, levy and assess
