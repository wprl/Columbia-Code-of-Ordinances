<p class=texthead>Section 27-97 Request for meter test.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Any customer may request a meter test, to determine the 
accuracy of his meter at any time. 
Such test will be made by the department, by comparison with accurate standards. The results of 
such tests, when requested by the customer, shall be furnished to the customer.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If any test made at the request of the customer discloses 
that the meter is registering 
correctly, or within two (2) per cent of normal, the customer shall bear the expense of such test, 
not to exceed sixteen dollars ($16.00) for residential meters or thirty-two dollars ($32.00) for 
commercial and industrial meters. The expense of all other tests shall be borne by the 
department.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If any meter is found to register more than two (2) per 
cent above or below normal, then the 
readings of that meter, previously taken for billing purposes, shall be corrected according to the 
percentage of inaccuracy found. The customer's bill shall be adjusted upward or downward as the 
case may be, for the corrected period.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) After testing, meters shall be calibrated and restored 
to an accurate condition in accordance 
with industry standards, before being placed in service.</div>
