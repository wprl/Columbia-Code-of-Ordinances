<p class=texthead>Section 27-56 Customer's water installation.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The customer's water installation shall extend from:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discharge of the water meter, 
where the meter is located at or near the property line.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property line, where the meter 
is located elsewhere on the property.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water main tap, where an unmetered 
fire protection or sprinkler system serves the 
property, or where a private water main is extended from the city water main.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The customer assumes all responsibility for the construction, 
maintenance, and any 
necessary relocation of the customer's water installation; he shall make every effort to keep this 
system free from leaks. Apparent leaks in the customer's water installation, whether registered on 
the water meter or not, shall be repaired by the customer within ten (10) days of receipt of 
written notice by the department. If repairs are not made, the department shall issue written 
notice of disconnection, and five (5) days thereafter may discontinue water service until the leak 
is repaired. If, in the judgment of the department, an apparent leak in the customer's water 
installation endangers public safety, constitutes a serious nuisance, or wastes a considerable 
amount of water, the department may discontinue water service without previous notice to the 
customer. Hidden leaks in the customer's water installation shall be repaired, after discovery, 
under the same provisions as apparent leaks. If any leak is known or suspected to have registered 
on the water meter, and if the customer, upon discovery or notification of the leak, has promptly 
repaired or caused to be repaired such leak, the customer's water and sewer charge (if affected) 
for a period not exceeding three (3) months, including the billing period during which the leak 
was discovered and two (2) previous periods, shall be adjusted downward in the amount of one-half the 
normal charge for the excess water.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If any customer fails to promptly repair apparent leaks 
or hidden leaks after notification, or 
to take other measures to eliminate the wasting of water through leaking installations, no 
adjustment of monthly charges will be made.</div>
