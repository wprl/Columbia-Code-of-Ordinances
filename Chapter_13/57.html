a 
license under standards set out in this article, is found guilty of any charge involving the misuse 
of firearms, or becomes manifestly or demonstrably incapable of meeting the safety, law, or 
skills standards, or if any licensee shall willfully conceal information or facts concerning such 
matters, or fails to maintain the surety bond required hereunder, such license shall be subject to 
immediate revocation. The business license administrator shall immediately give notice of 
revocation and afford the licensee opportunity to be heard by the business license administrator. 
The business license administrator is empowered to conduct ongoing investigations to determine
