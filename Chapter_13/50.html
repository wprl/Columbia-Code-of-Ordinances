be determined by the chief to have 
met or exceeded adequate standards for firearms safety, knowledge of the law with regard to the

seventy (70) percent on each section, a test provided by and administered by the chief, said test 
to include written sections on firearms safety, firearms law, and firearms skills and a shooting 
section on firearms safety and firearms skills, and a qualifying course of fire, the standards of 
which shall be set out in regulations promulgated by the chief. The handgun and ammunition
