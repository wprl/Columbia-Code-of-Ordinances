of a waste hauler to dispose of 
the contents of privies or manure, except at the city landfill or other solid waste disposal facility 
which is licensed and approved by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in the activities 
of a licensed waste hauler to 
transport or dispose of any liquid waste, except in the manner and at locations designated by the 
director of public works. &nbsp;The director may require the pretreatment of the contents of acceptable 
liquid waste loads and may require sampling and analyses of the wastes before allowing 
dumping, and may refuse to allow dumping if in the director&#146;s discretion allowing the dumping 
would violate any wastewater treatment regulations or requirements, cause damage to the 
treatment process or facility, or a hauler violates any regulation or ordinance regarding use of the 
plant.</div>
