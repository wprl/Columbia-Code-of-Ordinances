<p class=texthead>Section 5-9 Dangerous exotic animals.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person shall keep, harbor, 
own or knowingly allow to be in or upon the person's 
premises any dangerous exotic animal. &nbsp;The provisions of this section shall not apply to a 
properly maintained and licensed zoological park, circus, scientific or educational institution, 
research laboratory or veterinary hospital. </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any animal that is determined 
by an animal control officer to be a dangerous exotic 
animal shall be immediately impounded. Except for exigent circumstances, if the owner of the 
dangerous exotic animal does not consent to removal of the animal or if the owner of the 
property on which the animal is located does not consent to entry onto the property, the animal 
control officer shall enter the property and remove the animal only pursuant to a warrant issued 
by a judge. The dangerous exotic animal shall remain impounded until: </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director determines that the 
animal is not an exotic dangerous animal; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner satisfies an animal 
control officer that the animal will be kept in a lawful 
manner; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner relinquishes ownership 
of the animal and the animal is either humanely 
destroyed or placed with a person who shall keep the animal in a lawful manner; or </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person charged with a violation 
of this section has been found not guilty and the judge 
orders the animal released; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A court determines that the animal 
is not a dangerous exotic animal.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the dangerous exotic 
animal shall pay the boarding fee and impoundment 
fee provided for in section 5-5 plus any additional cost incurred by the city in feeding and caring 
for the animal. The owner shall be billed periodically by the city for such fees and expenses. If 
the owner fails to pay such a bill within ten (10) days after it was mailed, ownership of the 
animal shall be deemed relinquished and, after the procedures of this section have been followed, 
the animal may either be humanely destroyed or placed with a person who shall keep the animal 
in a lawful manner. Bills for fees and costs under this section shall notify the animal owner that 
if the bill is not paid within ten (10) days, the animal will be destroyed or placed with some 
person who shall keep the animal in a lawful manner. The bill shall also state that the animal 
owner may meet with the director or the director's designee to dispute whether the animal is a 
dangerous exotic animal or the amount of the bill before the animal is destroyed or placed with 
another person. If the animal owner wishes to meet, the owner must request a meeting in writing. 
The request must be delivered to the director at the address given for this purpose on the bill. The 
request must be delivered before the deadline for disposition of the animal indicated on the bill.</div>
