&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <i>Generally.</i> Any livestock found upon property not owned or controlled 
by the livestock 
owner and not under the control of some competent person may be captured and impounded by 
the animal control officer, or any person designated by him. The owner of impounded livestock 
shall be liable for all reasonable charges for capturing and impounding such livestock, including 
all charges incidental thereto.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <i>Sale of unclaimed, unpaid-for livestock.</i> In the event that impounded 
livestock is not 
claimed or charges associated with the impoundment of livestock are not paid within fifteen (15) 
days, the director may direct that the livestock be sold at public auction, which shall occur no 
sooner than ten (10) days after notice of the time, date and place of sale, and a description of the 
livestock and location of capture has been posted in at least five (5) public places in the city. In 
case no bidders appear at such sale, the director may sell the livestock at private sale, securing 
the best possible price. From the proceeds of any sale held hereunder, the director shall first 
deduct </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
the director&#146;s </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
charges or expenses and pay </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
the director&#146;s </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
charges or expenses, and pay the 
balance into the city treasury, and such sums shall become a part of the general revenue fund. If 
at any time prior to the sale, the owner of such livestock shall exhibit satisfactory proof of 
ownership, </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
the owner </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
shall be entitled to redeem the livestock upon the payment of all fees and 
expenses. If, within six (6) months after the sale of the livestock, as above provided, the owner of 
any such livestock so sold shall exhibit to the council satisfactory proof of <strike>&nbsp;</strike>ownership, 
the 
proceeds coming into the city treasury from such sale, after deduction of all charges and 
expenses, shall be refunded to </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
the owner</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
. Should the proceeds of the sale be inadequate to meet 
the city expenses, the owner shall be billed for the unpaid balance.</span></font></div>
