attacks any person shall be immediately impounded for a period of ten (10) days. The animal 
shall be impounded in Boone County, Missouri by the animal's owner with a veterinarian of the 
owner's choice or with a veterinarian in another location approved by the director or the director's

manifest rabies, it may be redeemed by the owner upon the payment of the boarding fee and 
impoundment fee provided for in section 5-5 if the animal is in the custody of the city, or the 
payment of usual and customary fees if the animal has been in the custody of a veterinarian of 
the owner's choice. If the animal is not redeemed at the end of the ten-day period, it shall be 
humanely disposed of, as provided for in this chapter. If the animal develops signs of rabies, the
