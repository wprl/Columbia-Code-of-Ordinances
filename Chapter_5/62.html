Prior to issuing a license tax certificate and license tag, the deputy business license 
administrator shall require the owner to present satisfactory evidence that the animal has been 
vaccinated for rabies and that such vaccination, if any, will be effective during the full term for 
which such animal license is issued. If the owner cannot present such satisfactory evidence of 
such vaccination, the deputy shall, before issuing a license certificate, cause the animal to be 
vaccinated for rabies at the expense of the owner with a type of vaccine approved by the director. 
In evidence of such vaccination, the deputy shall issue to the owner an appropriate certificate of 
such vaccination bearing the date of vaccination, vaccination certificate number, and the name 
and address of the veterinarian.</span></font></div>
