<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <i>Authority, findings of fact and purposes.</i></span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Authority.</i> The city council of the City of 
Columbia, Missouri enacts these floodplain 
management regulations under its authority to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the 
health, safety and general welfare which authority was granted to the City of Columbia as a home 
rule charter city by the people of the State of Missouri in Article VI, Section 19(a) of the 
Missouri Constitution and by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri in Chapter 89 of the 
Missouri Revised Statutes.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Findings of fact.</i></span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flood losses resulting from 
periodic inundation. The flood hazard areas of Columbia, 
Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety 
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures 
for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the 
public health, safety and general welfare.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General causes of these flood 
losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) The 
cumulative effect of obstructions in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities, 
(2) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, 
which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods used to analyze flood 
hazards. This section uses a reasonable method of 
analyzing flood hazards which consists of the following series of interrelated steps:</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection 
of regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which 
permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area 
inundated, and the depth of inundation. The regulatory flood selected for this section is 
representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to 
occur on the particular streams subject to this section. It is in the general order of a flood which 
could be expected to have a one (1) per cent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year, as 
delineated by the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood Insurance Study, and illustrative 
materials dated March 17, 2011, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculation 
of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the 
capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computation 
of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood 
heights more than one (1) foot at any point.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delineation 
of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted 
which would cause any increase in flood height.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delineation 
of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines 
but which still is subject to inundation by the regulatory flood.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of the floodplain overlay 
district is to promote the public health, 
safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in subsection (a)(2)a. to 
establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance 
Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 59.22(a)(3), and to meet the 
requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this section to:</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrict or prohibit uses 
that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of 
flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Require that uses vulnerable 
to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, 
be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protect individuals from buying 
lands that are unsuited for intended purposes because 
of flood hazard.</span></font></div>

as A zones (including AE, AO and AH zones) dated March 
17, 2011 as amended and any future revisions thereto, and that portion of the X zone shaded, 
other flood areas, which is in the upper square mile of a flood drainage area. In all areas covered 
by this section, no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain 
permit to develop granted by the director of public works under such safeguards and restriction 
as the director of public works may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the 
general welfare and health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in 
this section.</span></font></div>
<br>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The enforcement officer.</i> The director of public 
works is hereby designated as the duly 
designated Local Floodplain Administrator under this section.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rules for interpretation of district boundaries.</i> 
The boundaries of the floodway, flood 
fringe, and flood drainage area shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning 
map or on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map. Where interpretation is needed to the 
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, as for 
example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field 
conditions, the director of public works shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases 
where the interpretation is contested, the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute. The 
regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the 
district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be 
given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical 
evidence, if he so desires.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Compliance.</i> No development within known flood 
hazard areas of the City of Columbia 
shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the 
terms of this section and other applicable regulations.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Abrogation and greater restrictions.</i> It is 
not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate 
or impair any existent easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section 
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances 
inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Interpretation.</i> In their interpretation and 
application, the provisions of this section shall 
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council 
and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Warning and disclaimer of liability.</i> The degree 
of flood protection required by this 
section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and 
scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may 
be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by 
debris. This section does not imply that areas outside of the floodway, flood fringe, and flood 
drainage area boundaries or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or 
flood damage. This section shall not create liability on the part of the City of Columbia or any 
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this section 
or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Severability.</i> If any subsection, clause, provision 
or portion of this section is adjudged 
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section 
shall not be affected thereby.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeal.</i> Where a request for a floodplain development 
permit to develop or for a variance 
is denied by the director of public works the applicant may apply for such floodplain 
development permit or variance to these regulations directly to the board of adjustment.</span></font></div>
