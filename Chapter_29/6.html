&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use shall not generate traffic in volumes greater 
than would normally be expected in

unit per twenty-four-hour period. The use shall not use commercial or business vehicles to 
deliver finished products from the dwelling unit. All parking necessarily generated by the use 
shall be off the street in accordance with section 29-30 of this chapter.</span></font></div>
