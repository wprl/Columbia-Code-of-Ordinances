&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <i>Landscape plan requirements.</i> A landscaping plan, prepared by an individual 
who can 
demonstrate knowledge of landscape design, shall be required as specified in chapter 12-A, the 
Land Preservation Act. In addition to those requirements, approval of a landscape plan shall be 
required prior to the issuance of building permits and prior to the development of any parking 
area or loading/unloading area.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <i>Screening and landscaping requirements.</i> In addition to the requirements 
and purpose of 
the Land Preservation Act:</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total land 
area of any tract, parcel or lot shall 
be landscaped. Landscaping shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No new buildings or additions to existing buildings 
shall be permitted unless additional 
landscaping is provided on the tract, parcel or lot in an area equal to at least fifteen percent 
(15%) of the land area occupied by the new building or addition. This subsection shall not apply 
to any land which meets the minimum requirement of subsection (e)(1).</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All paved areas with more than fifty (50) feet of 
length, within twenty (20) feet of a 
street right-of-way shall have a six (6) feet wide street yard landscaping strip within private yards 
separating parking areas from abutting street rights-of-way containing no less than four (4) of the 
categories of planting materials listed in paragraph (f) of this section. The street yard landscaping 
strip shall contain one tree per fifty (50) feet of street frontage. Such trees may be clustered or 
arranged within the area and need not be placed at even intervals. The street yard landscaping 
strip may contain driveways.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No parking areas shall contain more than one hundred 
fifty (150) spaces. If a greater number 
is required, separate parking areas of not more than one hundred fifty (150) spaces shall be 
provided and shall be separated by a landscaped area of at least ten (10) feet in width. The ten 
(10) feet wide landscaped area shall contain four (4) of the categories of planting materials listed 
in paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, trees shall be planted within the ten (10) feet wide 
landscaped area at the rate of one tree for each fifty (50) lineal feet. Appropriately placed 
connections between parking areas are permitted.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No less than fifty (50) percent of the linear street 
frontage forming the perimeter of parking 
areas described above, exclusive of driveways and entrances, shall contain screening materials. 
These materials may consist of plantings from the tree and shrub categories, or ornamental 
fences or walls, or earthen berms, or some combination thereof. This screening shall extend to a 
minimum of three (3) feet above the grade of the parking lot.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, paved areas developed after 
August 19, 1991, and additions to 
paved areas which were developed prior to August 19, 1991, exceeding four thousand five 
hundred (4,500) square feet in area shall contain a minimum of one (1) tree for every four 
thousand five hundred (4,500) square feet of paved area. All required trees planted to achieve 
compliance are to be distributed in a configuration which shades the paved areas within the site. 
In a case where the location of trees within the site interferes with the loading and unloading of 
large vehicles, the required trees may be placed at the perimeter of the paved areas or in other 
suitable locations on the site. All required trees planted to achieve compliance must be a locally 
adapted species, approved for the site by the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community development</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
. The director of 
</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community development </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
is authorized to adopt and maintain a list of approved species to be used 
for planting required by this section. When a site, in the opinion of the director of </span></font><span 
style="font-size:11pt">
community 
development</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
, is configured in a manner that makes planting of required trees impractical or 
unsafe, shrubs and ground cover may be substituted for trees. Existing trees saved on the site 
within the parking area may be credited toward minimum tree requirements only if it is 
demonstrated that they have been properly protected during and following development and if 
they meet the size requirements of chapter 12A.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paved areas containing more than one thousand five 
hundred (1,500) square feet within 
fifty (50) feet of a residential use or residential zoning district or any motor vehicle 
loading/unloading areas within fifty (50) feet of a residential use or residential zoning district, 
but not separated by street right-of-way, shall be screened from view of the adjoining residential 
use or residential zoning district, by landscaping materials, ornamental fence and walls in 
combination with plant materials, properly stabilized earthen berms, or a combination of any of 
these methods. Screening shall be so designed that at least eighty (80) per cent opacity is 
achieved, viewed horizontally, in the space between one foot and five (5) feet above grade at the 
screen line, at the time of installation; provided, that where plant materials are used for 
screening, these shall be selected and placed to achieve the same objective within four (4) full 
growing seasons following planting. All screening material, including plant material, shall be 
continuously maintained in good condition, to the above standards.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landscaping and screening shall not be allowed to 
obstruct the view of motorists using 
any street, private driveway, parking aisles or the approach to any street intersection so as to 
constitute a traffic hazard or condition dangerous to the public safety upon any such street.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the combined total number of trees required to 
be planted in the six (6) feet wide 
street yard landscaping strip and in the interior parking lot, no less than thirty (30) percent shall 
be of a species of medium to large shade trees.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots which contain attached residences and which 
have side or rear property boundaries 
abutting collector or arterial street right of way shall have screening either along such boundaries 
or around any patios on the lot which are visible from the right of way. The screening shall 
consist of landscape materials, ornamental fences or walls in combination with plant materials, 
properly stabilized earthen berms, or a combination of these methods. Screening shall be so 
designed that at least 50 percent opacity is achieved, viewed horizontally, in the space between 
one foot and five feet above grade at the screening line, at the time of installation; provided that 
where plant materials are used for screening, these shall be selected and placed to achieve the 
same objective within four (4) full growing seasons following planting. Screening shall be placed 
on private property. All screening material, including plant material, shall be continuously 
maintained in good condition to the above standards.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required landscaping shall not be installed until 
all street yard landscaping strips, 
setbacks, tree planting sizes and locations, screening locations and overall planting 
configurations are inspected and approved by the city. Deviations from the approved plans shall 
be corrected to conform to the approved plan. If, in the opinion of the director of </span></font><span 
style="font-size:11pt">
community 
development</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
, compliance is not achievable due to unforeseen circumstances, the landscaping 
plan may be amended, but in all cases must comply with the requirements of the landscaping 
requirements for the zoning district in which the site is located.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All landscaping called for in the approved landscape 
plan, living and non-living, shall be 
in place and approved by the city prior to issuance of certificates of occupancy. It shall be 
unlawful to occupy any structure, or to represent to any person that the structure may be 
occupied, prior to the final approval of the landscaping. If, at the time of request for the 
certificate, the required landscaping would be jeopardized by weather conditions, the developer 
shall comply with applicable provisions of chapter 12A.</span></font></div>

agents who are authorized to maintain the property, shall be responsible for the continued 
maintenance. Plant material which exhibits evidence of insect pest disease or damage shall be 
appropriately treated, and dead plants promptly removed and replaced within the next planting 
season. All landscaping will be subject to periodic inspection by the city to ensure compliance.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) <i>Alternative methods of compliance.</i> Although certain material or a 
particular method of 
construction is specifically prescribed by this section, this section is not intended, especially 
whenever a stream, natural rock formation or other physiographic condition exists, to prevent the 
use of a material or method of construction not prescribed specifically by this section; provided, 
any such alternate material or method has been approved in writing or in plan and its use 
authorized by the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community development</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

less than four (4) of the categories of planting materials listed in paragraph (f) of this section. 
Such landscaping strip shall not be subject to the tree or screening requirements imposed by 
subsection (e)(3); except that the required landscaped areas shall include not less than one 
ornamental or other type of tree for each 4,500 square feet of paved area, provided however, that 
one (1) large shrub or two (2) medium shrubs may be substituted for each required tree. &nbsp;A large 
shrub is defined as one that reaches at least six (6) feet in height in four (4) growing seasons, and 
a medium shrub is defined as one that reaches at least thirty (30) inches in height in three (3)
