allows any violation of this provision to exist.</div>
<br>

<div align=left>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transit Incentive. &nbsp;Upon application of the owner, the 
parking requirement of a building or 
use may be reduced by 5 percent for lots or tracts of two (2) acres or more located on a transit

location acceptable to the City.</div>

<div align=left>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Shared Parking.</i> Upon application of the owners, facilities may be shared if multiple uses 
cooperatively establish and operate parking facilities and if these uses generate parking demands 
at different times. (For example, if one use operates during evenings and weekends only and 
other uses operate during weekdays only). The applicant shall have the burden of proof for a 
reduction in the total number of required parking spaces, and shall provide required

<div align=left>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed Uses. &nbsp;Generally, in mixed uses, the parking facilities 
required shall be the sum of 
the requirements for the various individual uses, computed separately in accordance with this

facilities for any other use, except as approved above in subsection (f) Shared Parking.</div>

<div align=left>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location of Facilities. &nbsp;Except as otherwise provided 
in this section, off-street automobile

the premises of the parking generator or within one thousand (1,000) feet therefrom. &nbsp;Land used 
for parking shall be zoned to accommodate the generating use. &nbsp;All off-premises parking

to assure positive drainage, but shall 
not exceed a slope of ten (10) percent; provided that transitional and approach driveways which 
do not serve directly abutting parking spaces may be designed to a slope of up to fifteen (15) 
percent, if accompanied by appropriate landing grades and vertical curves at points of transition.

<br>
<div align=left>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curb islands or wheel stops may be installed for drainage 
control, and for vehicular 
channelization and lane control; provided, that in parking areas of more than one hundred (100)
