<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose and intent. &nbsp;It is the 
goal of the city of Columbia to enable citizens to pursue 
alternative and sustainable energy sources for their homes. In accordance with this goal, the city 
finds that it is in the public interest to encourage alternative energy systems, particularly wind 
energy conversion systems (WECS), that have a positive impact on energy production and 
conservation while not adversely impacting the community. </div>
<br>

any battery or other storage device.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of 
the shadow flicker analysis, if required. &nbsp;This shall apply only to systems 
greater than 10kW in nameplate generating capacity. &nbsp;No WECS shall be installed and operated 
in a manner that causes shadow flicker to fall on or in any residential dwelling existing at the 
time the application to install a WECS is received by the city. &nbsp;The applicant has the burden of 
proving that this effect does not have significant adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent uses, 
either through siting or mitigation. &nbsp;Shadow flicker expected to fall on an adjacent parcel or 
roadway may be acceptable if the flicker does not exceed thirty (30) hours per calendar year. &nbsp;If 
such flicker is likely, the applicant shall, at the applicant&#146;s sole expense, furnish a flicker 
study 
for City review.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify><span style="font-size:11pt">
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for permits.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit required:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
shall be unlawful to construct, erect, install, alter or locate any WECS within the 
city of Columbia, unless a building permit has been obtained. &nbsp;The building permit may be 
revoked by the building official any time the approved system does not comply with the rules set 
forth in this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorization 
for interconnection to the electric grid is independent of the approval 
for the WECS building permit. &nbsp;If an interconnected system is planned, the applicable utility&#146;s 
interconnection requirements must also be satisfied, and no building permit shall be issued until 
the building official has been provided with that utility&#146;s written authorization.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for permits. &nbsp;Building 
and, if necessary. conditional use permits and 
variances shall be applied for and reviewed under the procedures established in this chapter, 
except where noted below. &nbsp;The director of community development, upon written request of the 
applicant, may waive any of the submittal requirements that the director deems not applicable 
after reviewing the request. &nbsp;Applicants desiring such a waiver shall provide supporting 
documentation from a licensed engineer justifying the waiver. &nbsp;The director may also require 
additional information as minimally needed to determine compliance with this Code.</div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General requirements and construction.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tower. &nbsp;Only monopole towers 
are permitted for freestanding WECS. &nbsp;Guyed or any 
other types of towers are not permitted.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color 
and surface. &nbsp;Freestanding WECS shall be a neutral color such as white or 
light gray. &nbsp;Supporting structures for building-mounted WECS shall match the color of the 
building on which they are mounted. Surfaces of the WECS and building-mounted supporting 
structures shall be a non-reflective, matte finish.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signage 
and visual impact. &nbsp;No lettering, advertising, or graphics other than a 
standard manufacturer&#146;s insignia shall be on any part of the tower, hub, or blades. &nbsp;No other 
signage or message may be displayed, other than for safety or apparatus identification (e.g. 
nameplate, serial number or emergency instructions). &nbsp;The applicant shall avoid state or federal 
scenic areas and significant visual resources listed in the city&#146;s comprehensive plan.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing 
apparatus. &nbsp;The tower must be designed to prevent climbing within the first 
ten (10) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting. &nbsp;No lights shall 
be installed on the tower, unless required to meet Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines, where lighting intensity and frequency of strobe shall 
adhere to requirements established by FAA permits and regulations. &nbsp;Red strobe lights are 
preferred for nighttime illumination and to reduce impacts on migrating birds. &nbsp;Red pulsating 
incandescent lights shall be prohibited unless required by the FAA.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance. &nbsp;All WECS equipment 
and connections must adhere to all applicable local 
and state regulations and relevant national and international codes. &nbsp;In case of noncompliance, 
the applicant may be required to hire outside inspectors as deemed necessary by the building 
official or Board of Adjustment.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance. &nbsp;Facilities 
shall be installed and maintained in accordance with 
manufacturer&#146;s specifications. &nbsp;The property owner of any WECS shall maintain such system 
in a 
safe and attractive manner, including replacement of defective parts, painting, cleaning, and other 
acts that may be required for the maintenance and function of such a system. &nbsp;Failure to maintain 
the WECS may result in enforcement action including, but not limited to, citations, fines, or 
revocation of permits in accordance with this code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise, vibration, and sound pressure 
level. &nbsp;A WECS shall be designed, installed and 
operated so that any noise or vibration has minimal impact on adjacent properties. &nbsp;A WECS 
shall not exceed 55 dB(A) at any adjacent property line. &nbsp;This sound pressure level may be 
exceeded during short-term events such as utility outages or severe wind storms. &nbsp;If the ambient 
sound level for the WECS location exceeds 55 dB(A), the maximum standard shall be ambient 
dB(A) plus 5 dB(A). &nbsp;No WECS shall emit low frequency sound at or below 20 Hertz. &nbsp;The 
process for reporting and investigating a noise complaint is as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon 
written notification of a complaint of excessive noise, the building official or 
designated representative of the community development department (the &#147;enforcing person&#148;), 
shall record the filing of such complaint and promptly investigate it. &nbsp;If noise levels are 
determined to be in excess of the maximum standard, the enforcing person shall require the 
property owner to perform ambient and operating decibel measurements at the nearest point from 
the wind turbine to the property line of the complainant and to the nearest off-site, inhabited 
residence.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
the noise levels are found to have exceeded the allowable limit, the enforcing 
person shall notify, in writing, the owner of the WECS site to correct the violation. &nbsp;If the noise 
violation is not remedied within thirty (30) days, the WECS shall remain inactive until the noise 
violation is remedied, which may include (but is not limited to) relocation or removal at the 
owner&#146;s expense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
it is determined that maximum noise limits have not been exceeded, notice in 
writing shall be provided to the person who has filed such complaint and the owner of the WECS 
property stating that no further action is required, within twenty-one (21) days of the receipt of 
the request. Any person aggrieved by the decision may appeal the decision to the Board of 
Adjustment in accordance with section 29-31. &nbsp;Any such appeal must be filed within thirty (30) 
days of receipt of the enforcing person&#146;s decision.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interconnection and utility considerations. &nbsp;The applicant shall notify and apply with the 
appropriate electric utility in making a WECS application to install an interconnected, customer-owned 
WECS. &nbsp;The WECS shall meet the requirements for interconnection and operation as set 
forth by the utility, and shall not be interconnected to any utility-operated power line or by any 
other means of conveyance until so authorized by the utility. &nbsp;Interconnected WECS shall require 
the approval of the applicable utility before receiving permits from the city. &nbsp;Off-grid (not 
connected to the utility) systems shall be exempt from this application requirement. &nbsp;A response 
from the utility is not required to approve or deny an off-grid WECS application.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restriction on use of electricity 
generated. &nbsp;A WECS shall be used exclusively to supply 
electrical power to the owner for on-site consumption, except that excess electrical power 
generated by the WECS and not presently needed for use by the owner may be used by the utility 
in accordance with laws and regulations governing interconnection and utility approval.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeder lines. &nbsp;All communications 
and feeder lines installed as part of a WECS shall be 
buried where feasible.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displacement of parking and landscaping 
prohibited. &nbsp;The location of the WECS shall 
not result in the net loss of required parking or landscaping as specified elsewhere in the zoning 
code.</div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
minimum distance between any freestanding WECS and any property line shall 
be the distance equivalent to the fall zone, which is ninety (90) percent of the total system height. 
&nbsp;No part of the fall zone shall cross an adjacent property line. The setback shall be measured 
from the property line to the point of the WECS structure closest to the property line.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>For building-mounted WECS, no part of the fall zone shall cross an adjacent property 
line. &nbsp;The 
fall zone for a building-mounted WECS shall be fifty (50) percent of the height as measured from 
the lowest attachment to the building/structure to the highest point of the blades or rotors.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>The fall zone shall be entirely contained on the subject parcel. &nbsp;In no case 
may the fall zone 
radius include an overhead electric power line. &nbsp;The setback from underground electric 
distribution lines shall be at least five (5) feet; the fall zone radius may include the underground 
line(s). &nbsp;Section 29-26, regarding allowable minor projections into required setbacks, is not 
applicable.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum height for any WECS (freestanding 
or building-mounted) shall be the total 
system height, defined as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, RMH, and C-1 districts, forty-five (45) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
the C-3 district, sixty (60) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
the O-1 and O-2 districts, ninety (90) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
the C-2, M-1, M-R, and M-C districts, one hundred twenty (120) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
lots greater than three (3) acres, one hundred fifty (150) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
all planned districts, height shall be as proposed in the statement of intent, subject 
to review by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city council.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum height may be exceeded, subject 
to approval of a conditional use permit by the 
board of adjustment. &nbsp;The applicant must demonstrate that additional height is needed and that 
the benefits of the taller WECS do not increase any adverse impacts.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: For lots in the A-1 zoning 
district, a maximum height of seventy-five (75) feet is 
allowed for windmills on agriculturally-used parcels under current zoning district standards. 
&nbsp;This standard shall apply to all WECS applications on parcels of three (3) acres or fewer in the 
A-1 district.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other regulations:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WECS 
and their associated outbuildings and cabinets shall meet all setback 
requirements for primary structures for the zoning district in which the WECS is located. A 
WECS and its associated outbuildings and accessories shall not be located forward of the 
principal structure on a lot.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No 
other apparatus or mechanical and electronic equipment, such as 
telecommunication antennas, microwave dishes, or satellite dishes, shall be attached to a WECS 
tower or its associated components such as the nacelle.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No part 
of a WECS shall be located within or over public drainage, utility or other 
established easements.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No WECS 
shall be constructed, altered, or maintained so as to project above any of the 
airspace surfaces described in FAR Part 77 of the FAA guidance on airspace protection.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No part 
of the WECS, including the swept area, shall be within or overhang any 
portion of the property that is within a required building setback.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discontinuation and decommissioning. &nbsp;A WECS shall be considered abandoned after six 
(6) months without energy production, unless a plan is developed and submitted to the enforcing 
person outlining the steps and schedule for returning the WECS to service. &nbsp;All WECS and 
accessory facilities shall be removed in their entirety within ninety (90) days of abandonment. &nbsp;If 
this is not done, the city&#146;s standard procedures for nuisance removal may be followed at the 
discretion of the building official or the official&#146;s designee.</div>
