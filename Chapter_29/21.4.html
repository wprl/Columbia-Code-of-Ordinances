community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development and approved by the historic preservation commission. The 
petition shall clearly identify all historic and architectural features proposed for regulation. The 
petition shall identify the facts which support a determination that the proposed landmark or 
historic district meets the criteria for designation set forth in this section. The petition shall be 
filed with the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

style="font-size:11pt">
community 
</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

districts shall be determined by the same standards 
used by the National Register of Historic Places, as laid out in Defining Boundaries for National 
Register Properties: National Register Bulletin 21 (Washington D.C.: U.S. Department of the 
Interior, 1995). &nbsp;Gerrymandering which has the apparent effect of overwhelming significant areas 
of opposition is prohibited.</div>

required for interior construction or alteration of any structure in an historic district unless the

before the following actions affecting any historic or architectural feature identified in the 
ordinance placing the property in district HP may be undertaken:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any construction, alteration, removal, 
or any demolition in whole or in part regardless of

<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any construction, alteration, removal

the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

The application shall identify the facts which support a determination that the proposed actions 
meet the standards for review and design guidelines set forth in this section.</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
After determining that the application for certificate of appropriateness is complete, the 
director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development shall schedule the application for consideration by the 
historic preservation commission within a reasonable time. If a fully completed application for a 
certificate of appropriateness has not been acted upon within forty (40) days after the date the 
application was filed with the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development, it shall be deemed approved, 
unless tabled or continued with the consent of the applicant. No motion to table or continue shall 
be made without the consent of the applicant. The director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development shall 
conspicuously place a sign on the property giving public notice of the meeting at which the 
application shall be considered. The sign shall be placed at least seven (7) days prior to the

<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person aggrieved by the decision 
of the historic preservation commission may 
appeal to the board of adjustment by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within 30 days 
of the decision of the historic preservation commission. &nbsp;Notice of the historic preservation 
commission&#146;s decision shall be mailed to the applicant unless the applicant or the applicant&#146;s 
agent was present at the meeting at which the decision was made. &nbsp;The board of adjustment shall 
provide a hearing and render a decision in accordance with the provisions of chapter 536 RSMo.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Certificate of appropriateness; standards for review and 
design guidelines. &nbsp;In considering 
an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic preservation commission shall be 
guided by the following standards, and design guidelines in addition to any area-specific design 
guidelines included in the ordinance designating the landmark or historic district.</div>
<div align=left><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable efforts shall be made to provide a compatible 
use for a property which 
requires minimal alteration of the </div>
<div align=left>building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally 
intended 
purpose.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinguishing original qualities 
or character of a building, structure or site and its 
environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or 
distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building alterations that have no 
historical basis and which seek to create an earlier 
appearance shall not be allowed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes which may have taken place 
in the course of time are evidence of the history 
and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. When these changes have 
acquired significance in their own right, they shall be </div>
<div align=left>treated the same as if they were part of the original structure.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinctive stylistic features or 
examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a 
building, structure or site shall be preserved when possible.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deteriorated architectural features 
shall be repaired, rather than replaced, whenever 
practicable. If replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being 
replaced in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing 
architectural features shall be based upon accurate duplication of features, substantiated by 
historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of 
different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface cleaning of structures 
shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. 
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall 
not be undertaken. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every reasonable effort shall be 
made to protect and preserve archaeological resources 
affected by or adjacent to any project. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemporary design for alterations 
and additions to existing properties and for new 
construction may be permitted when such alterations, additions or new construction do not 
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible 
with the size, scale, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, new additions 
or alterations to structures shall be done in such a 
manner that, if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form 
and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.</div>
<div align=left><br>
