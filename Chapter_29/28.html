<p class=texthead>Section 29-28 Nonconforming uses.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The lawful use of land existing at the time of passage 
of Ordinance No. 9958, or 
annexation, although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof, may be continued. &nbsp;The 
nonconforming use of land shall not be extended or enlarged, either on the same or adjoining 
property. If such nonconforming use is discontinued, any future use of such premises shall be in 
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The lawful use of a building existing at the time of 
the passage of this article may be 
continued, although such use does not conform with the provisions hereof, and such use may be 
extended throughout the building, provided no structural alterations, except those required by 
law or ordinance, are made therein. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of 
a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted 
classification.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A nonconforming use of land or buildings, if changed 
to a conforming use or more 
restricted nonconforming use, may not thereafter be changed back to a less restricted use than 
that to which it was changed. If any property is hereafter transferred to a more restrictive district 
by a change in the district boundaries, or the regulations and restrictions in any district are made 
more restrictive or of a higher classification by amendment to this chapter, the provisions of this 
chapter relating to the nonconforming use of buildings or premises existing at the time of passage 
of this chapter shall apply to buildings or premises occupied or used at the time of the passage of 
such an amendment.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming 
building, provided that no 
structural alterations or extensions shall be made, except those required by law or ordinance, 
unless the building is changed to a conforming use, provided that the board, by special permit in 
the case of evident hardship, may grant an extension of a nonconforming use not exceeding 
twenty-five (25) per cent of the first floor.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the city or the Missouri 
Department of Transportation acquires a portion of a tract 
or parcel of land for right-of-way for a street project and the remaining property thereby becomes 
nonconforming to any zoning regulation, the property shall be treated as conforming to the 
zoning regulation to the following extent:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a building on the property that was conforming before 
the acquisition is destroyed, it may 
be rebuilt in the same configuration or with minor changes approved by the director of 
community development;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of community development, in calculating 
area restrictions for proposed 
construction on the property, shall consider the land acquired as if it remained part of the 
property. This provision, however, shall not apply to substantial redevelopment of the property.</div>
