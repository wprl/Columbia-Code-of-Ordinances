<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <i>Procedure:</i></span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person, firm or corporation, owning in fee simple 
real property within the city, may 
petition the council to amend, change, modify, supplement, or repeal the zoning district 
regulations and restrictions as established in this chapter pertaining to such real property; 
provided that such applicant shall specify the tract of land for which amendment, change, 
modification, supplement or restriction is sought, along with a specification of the zoning 
category which the applicant is seeking. No petition shall be presented, nor considered, which 
presents amendments, changes, modifications, supplements or restrictions to zoning categories in 
the alternative with respect to any lot, tract or parcel of land.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No petition to amend the zoning 
district map will be accepted if it is the same or 
substantially the same as a petition submitted within the previous twelve (12) months and which 
was denied by the city council or withdrawn by the applicant after a negative recommendation 
from the planning and zoning commission. &nbsp;The city council, at its discretion, may authorize a 
resubmittal within the twelve (12) month period after reviewing a written request from the 
applicant, which provides justification for the early resubmittal.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city council shall not 
rezone property to a classification less restrictive than the 
classification advertised and considered by the commission and shall not enlarge the area to be 
rezoned beyond the area advertised and considered by the commission.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall be construed 
to prevent an applicant from combining separate 
requests for amendment, change, modification, supplement or restriction for separate lots, tracts 
or parcels in common ownership in one petition, so long as no amendments, changes, 
modifications, supplements or restrictions are presented in the alternative.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such petition shall be on a form to be supplied by 
the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community 
</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development and filed with the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development. Such petitions shall be 
directed in the first instance to the commission. The director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development shall 
review the petition to determine technical compliance with the terms and conditions of this 
section, and if the petition and its supporting documents are found not to comply with the 
requirements of this section, the same shall be returned to the applicant for correction. At all 
times during the amendment process, however, the burden of supplying complete and accurate 
information contained in the petition for amendment and its supporting documents shall remain 
on the applicant.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petition shall contain an accurate legal description 
of the real property to be affected, 
the appropriate official street number and name for such property, the book and page numbers 
recording the latest deed to property, the existing zoning district, the requested zoning district or 
amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal of the chapter, the reason or reasons 
why such supplement, change, modification or repeal is requested, and shall be signed by one of 
the owners or his attorney. The petition shall be accompanied by a map clearly showing the 
affected property. Also, the petition shall list the names and addresses of the owners all land 
within lines drawn parallel to and one hundred eighty-five (185) feet from the boundaries of the 
land proposed to be rezoned. The petition shall also list the addresses of all residences (including 
apartments and manufactured homes) within the boundaries of the land proposed to be rezoned. 
The petition shall also be accompanied by a check made payable to the City of Columbia 
sufficient to cover all costs of advertisements of public hearing</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">

<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining that the petition and its supporting 
documents are in compliance with 
the requirements of this section, the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development shall set a date for a 
public hearing before the commission at the next regular meeting of the commission. Any 
omissions from the requirements of subsection (a)(3) will delay scheduling the request. The 
director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development or the commission shall cause a notice of the public hearing 
on the subject matter of the petition to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within 
the city and such public hearing shall not be held within a time earlier than fifteen (15) days from 
and after the date of publication. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The notice of public hearing shall contain an address or description of the general location of the 
real property to be affected. The notice shall also contain a map of the real property to be 
affected and the surrounding area. As a courtesy, the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development may 
send, by first class mail, notice of the public hearing before the commission on the proposed 
amendment to the addresses of the residences of the land to be rezoned and to the owners of all 
land within lines drawn parallel to and one hundred eighty-five (185) feet from the boundaries of 
the land proposed to be rezoned. The failure of the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community development </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
to send 
such notice or the failure of any resident or property owner to receive such notice shall not affect 
the validity of any ordinance rezoning land. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a courtesy, the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development may conspicuously place notification 
signs facing each street abutting the property to be rezoned. The sign face of notification signs 
shall be at least five (5) square feet. Notification signs shall have attached containers in which 
the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development shall place notices containing information on the 
rezoning and public hearing. The notice shall include the telephone number of the department of 
</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development. The failure of the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development to place 
notification signs shall not effect the validity of any ordinance rezoning land.</span></font></div>

<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development shall forward copies of the application and 
supporting documents to other administrative departments affected by the requested amendment,

change, or within an area determined by lines drawn parallel to and one hundred eighty-five 
(185) feet distant from the boundaries of the district proposed to be changed, such amendment
