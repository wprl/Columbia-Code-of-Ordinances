<p class=texthead>Section 29-19.1 District M-P, Planned General Industrial District.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of this M-P district is intended to enable innovation and flexibility 
in design and to promote environmentally sound and efficient use of land. &nbsp;The major objectives 
of the M-P district are:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow certain industrial uses 
in locations where a broad range of industrial uses might 
be inappropriate.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage development of such 
scale and character that it will be harmonious with 
surrounding areas and minimize any adverse impacts.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permitted uses. In district M-P, 
no building, land or premises shall be used and no 
building shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed or altered except for one or more 
of the uses allowed by the ordinance placing the property in district MP (for exceptions, see 
Section 2928, NonConforming Uses, and Section 2931, Board of Adjustment). &nbsp;The commission 
shall recommend and the council, at the time of rezoning, shall designate the use or uses allowed 
for the applicant&#146;s property from the following uses: </div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more or all of the permitted uses in districts M-R, 
M-C, M1 and C-3 (except those 
uses permitted in district R-3).</div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional Uses. The following uses 
shall be permitted in district M-P only after the 
issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to the provisions of section 29-23: </div>
<br>
<div align=left>Communication antennas and towers, subject to the provisions of section 29-21.3.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards and Criteria. The following 
standards and criteria shall apply to all M-P 
developments:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lot size. No minimum requirements.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Yards.</i> Yards shall be provided as follows:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front - Not less than twenty-five (25) feet from collector 
and arterial streets and fifteen (15) 
feet from all other streets.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rear - None, except not less than ten (10) feet when abutting 
a residential zoned district.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side - None, except that:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On corner lots the side yard shall be not less than twenty-five 
(25) feet adjacent to collector 
and arterial streets and not less than fifteen (15) feet from all other streets, and</div>
<br>
<div align=left>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side yard abutting a residential zoned district shall 
not be less than ten (10) feet.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>There shall be no setback required from a common area as long as the common area is 
at least as 
wide as the required yard. &nbsp;The applicant may request or the commission may recommend and 
the council may approve a lesser minimum yard.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Building height.</i> No specific maximum height, however, there shall be one additional foot 
of rear yard and interior side yard setback provided above the required minimum for each 
additional foot of height for buildings over 45 feet tall abutting a residential zoned district. &nbsp;The 
applicant may request or the commission may recommend and the council may approve a greater 
maximum building height.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision clearance. On any corner lot no wall, fence, sign 
or other structure or no plant 
growth of a type which would interfere with traffic visibility across the corner shall be permitted 
or maintained higher than three (3) feet above the curb level, within fifteen (15) feet of the 
intersection of the street right-of-way lines.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Parking and loading.</i> The provisions of section 29-30, off-street parking and loading, shall 
apply, except that the commission may approve a lesser parking requirement if, after considering 
the proposed use, the availability of other parking in the area (including parking on public 
streets) and other relevant factors, a lesser requirement is deemed appropriate.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>The commission may also recommend and the council may allow some of the required parking 
to 
be deferred. &nbsp;This shall be done by noting such parking spaces on the plan as &#147;future parking 
if 
needed.&#148; &nbsp;The future parking spaces may be placed within landscaped areas, as long as the 
landscaped areas are in excess of the 15% minimum of the site which is required to be in 
landscaping. &nbsp;The property owner shall establish additional parking spaces in the &#147;future 
parking&#148; area when directed to do so by the city council.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Screening and landscaping.</i> &nbsp;The provisions of Sec. 29-25 shall apply.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent screen consisting of a 
masonry wall, wood fence, landscaping material, or 
combination thereof, at least eight (8) feet in height and, when a fence is used, not to exceed 
twelve (12) feet in height, shall be required where a lot in this district abuts residentially zoned 
land. The required screening shall have an opacity of at least eighty (80) per cent year around 
and, if landscaping is used, the eighty (80) per cent opacity and eightfoot minimum height shall 
be achieved within four (4) full growing seasons. In the event a masonry wall or wood fence is 
used, landscaping shall be placed between the wall or fence and the property line to form an 
ornamental screen. The required screening and landscaping shall be maintained in good order 
and not allowed to exist in a state of disrepair or death. If wood fencing is used, it shall be 
durable in nature and treated to prevent rapid deterioration. Failure to maintain the required 
landscaping and screening shall be considered a violation of this chapter.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant may request or the commission 
may recommend and the council may 
approve less stringent or more stringent screening and landscaping requirements if, after 
considering topography, surrounding uses and other relevant factors, less stringent or more 
stringent screening and landscaping requirements are deemed appropriate.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission may recommend and the council may approve screening 
requirements for 
any lot in district M-P that abuts land that is not residentially zoned after considering the possible 
uses of the lot and the abutting property. The screening requirements shall be the same as in 
subsection (d)(6)a. and shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (d)(6)b.</div>
<div align=left></div>
<ol start=7>
<li>Drainage. &nbsp;A drainage system shall be designed to minimize the possibility of soil erosion 
and flood damage.
</ol>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access and Circulation. The traffic 
circulation system shall provide for the safe, 
convenient and efficient movement of goods and people with a minimum of conflict between 
various modes of travel. &nbsp;The streets within the proposed development shall be public and within 
a public right-of-way, except private streets may be permitted under the following conditions:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets shall be designed, constructed, and maintained 
according to any applicable 
minimum city standards for private streets;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets will serve two (2) or more lots or property in 
multiple ownership;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private streets do not provide the only vehicular access 
to public streets from other 
property located outside the development;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets shall be located in designated common areas which 
shall be platted as a separate 
lot or lots;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A notation shall be written on the approved plan and recorded 
plat which reads: &#147;All 
maintenance of the private streets shown on this plat shall be the responsibility of the owners 
association or abutting property owners. &nbsp;No private streets shall be dedicated to nor accepted 
by 
the city for maintenance until they have been improved to minimum city standards for public 
streets.&#148;; and</div>
<br>
<div align=left>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street signs for private streets shall indicate &#147;private 
street&#148; so as to distinguish them 
from public streets.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>Provisions shall be made for pedestrian travel within the development and shall connect 
with 
existing pedestrian systems or allow for future extensions to activity centers (i.e., schools, parks, 
shopping areas, etc.). &nbsp;Sidewalks shall be required along private streets as they would be required 
for public streets, except no sidewalks shall be required on the side of a street without any 
buildings or driveways.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Signs</i>. &nbsp;The provisions of Chapter 23 shall apply, except that the requirements pertaining 
to area, height, placement and number of freestanding signs and on-premise wall, canopy and 
awning signs shall be as approved by the council as part of the development plan.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Procedure for review and approval of MP zoning and the development plan.</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The first step in approval process should be a concept review to discuss and document 
the proposal. The concept review is an informal discussion and review between the director of 
</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
development and the developer to discuss land use and development concepts, 
applicable regulations, and other concerns that may be raised.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step shall be the submission 
of a request for rezoning to M-P. &nbsp;Rezoning shall 
be done in accordance with section 29-34 of this chapter and shall be accompanied by a 
statement of intent. &nbsp;The statement of intent shall be a letter, signed by the applicant or his 
agent, 
containing the following information about the proposed M-P development:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uses proposed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum gross square feet of building floor area proposed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum building height proposed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum percentage of the site to be maintained in open 
space.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>At the discretion of the applicant, the statement of intent may include other aspects 
of the 
proposed development.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>The statement of intent shall become part of the ordinance approving the M-P zoning 
and shall 
be binding upon the owners, their heirs and assigns until such time as the council shall release 
such limitations on the use of the subject property under the procedures provided herein. &nbsp;The 
statement of intent is also intended to provide guidance for any future revisions to the M-P 
development.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission shall then hold a 
public hearing. &nbsp;After the public hearing, the 
commission shall forward its recommendation to the council.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council shall approve, approve 
with conditions, or disapprove the M-P zoning 
request. An ordinance placing property in district M-P shall specify the uses allowed. Prior to a 
vote on an ordinance placing property in district M-P that contains conditions, the applicant shall 
be given an opportunity to:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accept the conditions; or</div>
<br>
<div align=left>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request a modification of the conditions; or</div>
<br>
<div align=left>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request that the application be voted on without conditions; 
or </div>
<br>
<div align=left>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request that the application be disapproved; or</div>
<br>
<div align=left>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdraw the application.</div>

<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After council approval of the rezoning, 
the applicant shall submit a development plan for 
review and approval by the commission. The development plan shall be processed in the same 
manner as a rezoning request. Advertising costs shall be at the applicant's expense. After the 
public hearing, the commission shall forward the development plan to the council with its 
recommendation. The council will then take action to approve, approve with conditions, or 
disapprove the plan.</div>
