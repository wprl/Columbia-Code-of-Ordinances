<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of this section is to establish standards for the development and 
operation of residential manufactured home parks. The standards are intended to provide for 
diverse housing opportunities while promoting neighborhood enhancement and minimizing 
conflicts with other zoning districts. A residential manufactured home park may provide sites 
(herein defined as manufactured home spaces) available for lease or rent; or the property may be 
subdivided in accordance with the requirements of this section and chapter 25.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Permitted uses.</i> In district RMH, no building, land or premises shall be used, and no 
building shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, located, relocated or altered except in 
conformance with an approved final development plan and except for one or more of the 
following uses:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>All permitted uses in district R-1, except that not more than two (2) permanent dwelling 
units 
will be allowed in each manufactured home park.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>Manufactured homes for single-family residential purposes only.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>Recreational uses for exclusive use of the occupants of the manufactured home park.</div>
