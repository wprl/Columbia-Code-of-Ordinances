<p>
<body>
<div align=left><span style="font-size:11pt">
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose. &nbsp;The purpose of this section 
is to:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide for the appropriate location and development of communications 
facilities and 
systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennas 
and towers through careful 
design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protect residential areas/land uses from potential adverse 
impacts of towers.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximize the use of existing and new towers so as to minimize 
the need to construct new 
or additional facilities.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximize and encourage the use of disguised support structures 
and antenna support 
structures so as to ensure the architectural integrity of designated areas within the City and the 
scenic quality of protected natural habitats.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of towers 
as a primary option rather than 
construction of additional towers.</div>
<br>
