are hereby 
established and adopted as shown on the map which is hereby designated as the &quot;Zoning District

the director&#146;s </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
office an authentic 
copy of such district map, and duplicate copies thereof, showing all the changes, amendments or 
additions thereto. When definite distances in feet are not shown on the zoning district map, the 
district boundaries on the zoning district map are intended to be along the existing street, alley or 
plotted lines, or extension of the same, and if the exact location of such line is not clear, it shall 
be determined by the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community development</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
, due consideration being given to 
location as indicated by the scale of the zoning district map.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) When streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or alleys as 
shown on the 
zoning district map, the director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
community development </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

on the map to the streets or alleys on the ground in such manner as to conform to the intent and 
purpose of this chapter.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Whenever any street or alley is vacated, the particular district in which 
the adjacent 
property lies shall be automatically extended to the centerline of any such street or alley.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Except as provided in subsection (f), all territory which may hereafter 
be annexed to the 
city shall automatically be placed in zoning district R-1 for a period of not more than six (6) 
months.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) During the six-month period referred to in (d) herein, the commission shall 
proceed to 
recommend permanent zoning to the council in the manner prescribed by law, within three (3)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) A petitioner for annexation may request that the petitioner's property in 
the area proposed 
to be annexed be placed in one or more specified zoning districts upon annexation. Except as 
modified by this section, the procedures set forth in section 29-34(a) and (c) shall apply to such 
zoning requests. When a request for zoning has been made under this subsection, </span></font><span 
style="font-size:11pt">
the </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
ordinance 
annexing the area shall place the area in one or more zoning districts. If the proposed annexation 
ordinance would place any property in the area to be annexed in a district other than that 
requested, the petition for annexation may be withdrawn at any time before passage of the 
ordinance.</span></font></div>
