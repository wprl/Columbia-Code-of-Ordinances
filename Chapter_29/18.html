parking to be deferred. &nbsp;This shall be done by noting such parking spaces on the plan as &#147;future 
parking if needed.&#148; &nbsp;The future parking spaces may be placed within landscaped areas, as long 
as 
the landscaped areas are in excess of the 15% minimum of the site which is required to be in 
landscaping. &nbsp;The property owner shall establish additional parking spaces in the &#147;future 
parking&#148; area when directed to do so by the city council.</div>

<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent screen consisting of a 
masonry wall, wood fence, landscaping material, or 
combination thereof, at least eight (8) feet in height and, when a fence is used, not to exceed 
eight (8) feet in height, shall be required where a lot in this district abuts residentially zoned land. 
The required screening shall have an opacity of at least eighty (80) per cent year around and, if 
landscaping is used, the eighty (80) per cent opacity and eightfoot minimum height shall be 
achieved within four (4) full growing seasons. In the event a masonry wall or wood fence is used, 
landscaping shall be placed between the wall or fence and the property line to form an 
ornamental screen. The required screening and landscaping shall be maintained in good order 
and not allowed to exist in a state of disrepair or death. If wood fencing is used, it shall be 
durable in nature and treated to prevent rapid deterioration. Failure to maintain the required 
landscaping and screening shall be considered a violation of this chapter.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All exterior storage areas shall be 
enclosed by a permanent screen at least eight (8) feet in 
height above the ground surface of the storage area. In the event that an eightfoot screen is 
inadequate to screen such an area, additional screening may be required in such a manner and of 
such materials as necessary to adequately screen such from public view. &nbsp;However, in no event 
shall the screen exceed twelve (12) feet &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in height, except for landscape materials. 
In no event 
shall the stored &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or stacked materials or finished products exceed the height 
of the required 
screening. The required screening shall have an opacity of at least eighty (80) per cent year 
around, and if landscaping is used, the eighty (80) per cent opacity shall be achieved within four 
(4) full growing seasons. When a solid wall, or any solid fence is used for screening, ornamental 
landscaping shall be placed between the fence and the adjacent property lines. The required 
screening shall be maintained in good order and not allowed to exist in a state of disrepair or 
death. If wood fencing is used, it shall be durable in nature or treated to prevent rapid 
deterioration. Failure to maintain the required screening shall be considered a violation of this 
chapter.</div>

The first step in approval process should be a concept review to discuss and document

development and the developer to discuss land use and development concepts,

<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The second step shall be the submission of a request for rezoning to M-R. &nbsp;Rezoning 
shall be done in accordance with Sec. 29-34 and shall be accompanied by a statement of intent. 
&nbsp;The statement of intent shall be a letter, signed by 
the applicant or his agent, containing the following information about the proposed M-R 
development:</span></font></div>

proposed development.</span></font></div>

The statement of intent shall become part of the ordinance approving the M-R zoning and shall 
be binding upon the owners, their heirs and assigns until such time as the council shall release 
such limitations on the use of the subject property under the procedures provided herein. &nbsp;The 
statement of intent is also intended to provide guidance for any future revisions to the M-R 
development.</span></font></div>

with conditions, or disapprove the M-R zoning 
request. An ordinance placing property in district M-R shall specify the uses allowed. Prior to a 
vote on an ordinance placing property in district M-R that contains conditions, the applicant shall 
be given an opportunity to:</div>
