<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations and requirements as to height of buildings 
and area of lot which may be 
occupied by buildings, side yards, front yards and rear yards; and other regulations and 
requirements as established in the sections of this chapter, shall be subject to the following 
exceptions and additional regulations:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Height:</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. In districts R-1, R-2 and R-3, 
where public or semi-public buildings, such as schools, 
museums, libraries, public administration buildings, etc., either public or private, are permitted, 
such buildings may be erected to a height not exceeding seventy-five (75) feet, unless a greater 
height is allowed, provided that such buildings shall be set back one additional foot on all sides 
for each additional foot that such buildings exceed the specified height limits as established by 
the regulations of the district in which such building is situated.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 
R-3 district only, schools may be constructed to a height of one hundred (100) 
feet without additional setback requirements.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwellings in districts R-1 and 
R-2 may be increased in height, not exceeding ten (10) 
feet, in addition to the limitation prescribed in such districts, provided that two (2) side yards of 
not less than fifteen (15) feet in width each, are provided.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parapet walls, false mansards, 
flagpoles, chimneys, finial cooling towers, elevator 
bulkheads, penthouses, stacks, cupolas, antennas (as defined in section 29-21.3) and spires shall 
not extend more than six (6) feet above the height limit.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On through lots one hundred twenty-five 
(125) feet or less in depth, the height of a 
building may be measured from the curb elevation of either street. On through lots of more than 
one hundred twenty-five (125) feet in depth, the greater height shall apply to a depth of not more 
than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from the higher street.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In district A-1, such items as 
silos, windmills, barns, and other structures normally 
associated with agricultural use of the land, may not exceed seventy-five (75) feet in height.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In districts R-1, R-2 and R-3, 
private noncommercial radio and television antennae may 
be permitted to be constructed to a height in excess of thirty-five (35) feet, but none shall be 
greater than forty-five (45) feet in height. Such antennae shall not be located in the front yard 
area of any lot, and shall be in compliance with all applicable laws and ordinances of the city.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Yard Exceptions:</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In districts R-1, R-2, R-3 and 
R-4, where lots composing forty percent (40%) or more of 
the frontage, on the same side of a street between two (2) intersecting streets (excluding reverse 
corner lots), are developed with buildings, the median of the front yards of such buildings shall 
establish the minimum front yard depth for the entire frontage. Where a recorded plat has been 
filed showing a setback line which otherwise complies with the requirements of this chapter, yet 
is less than the established setback for the block as provided above, such setback line shall apply.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where an official plan line has 
been established for future widening or opening of a 
street upon which a lot abuts, the depth or width of a yard shall be measured from such official 
plan line to the nearest line of the building.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every part of a required yard 
or court shall be open from its lowest point to the sky, 
unobstructed except for the ordinary projection of sills, belt courses, cornices, chimneys, 
buttresses, solar energy systems, ornamental features, and eaves. None of the above projections 
shall extend into a court more than six (6) inches nor into a minimum yard more than twenty-four 
(24) inches; and provided further, that canopies or open porches having a roof area not exceeding 
sixty (60) square feet may project a maximum of six (6) feet into the required front yard. Open 
paved terraces may project not more than ten (10) feet into a front or rear yard, and existing open 
porches extending into a required yard shall not be enclosed.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An open fire escape may project 
into a required side yard, but not more than half the 
width of such yard, and not more than four (4) feet from the building. Fire escapes, solid floored 
balconies, and enclosed outside stairways may project not more than four (4) feet into a rear 
yard.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrace garage in a district 
R-1 to R-3 inclusive, may be located in a front or side yard, 
provided that it is completely recessed into the terrace, and that the height of the terrace is 
sufficient to cover and conceal the structure from above, and further that the doors, when open, 
shall not project beyond any property line, and that the structure be set back at least four (4) feet 
from the front property line.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any residential district, a 
detached accessory building shall not:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceed 
twenty-four (24) feet in height;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be higher 
than the main building; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupy 
more than thirty (30) per cent of a rear yard.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A detached accessory building may 
be connected with the main building by a lightly 
constructed, covered passage, open on each side, not more than six (6) feet wide inside, the roof 
of which is not more than twelve (12) feet high at its highest point, and is not an extension of the 
roof of the main building.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No rear yard shall be required 
in any nonresidential district on any lot of which the rear 
line adjoins a railway right-of-way or which has a rear railway track connection.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In computing the depth of a rear 
yard for any building where such yard abuts an alley, 
one-half of such alley may be assumed to be a portion of the rear yard.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buildings constructed on the campus 
of an institution of higher learning, and which 
buildings have been included as part of a development plan approved by the council, need not 
comply with the yard requirements of the district in which they are located, but shall comply with 
the following requirements:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum 
distance to a street line--twenty-five (25) feet, except that where there is a 
building existing at the time of the passage of this section, with less than a twenty-foot setback 
on the same side of the street and within one hundred (100) feet on either side of the proposed 
building, such building may be located not less than twenty (20) feet from the street line.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum 
distance to a property line other than a street--fifteen (15) feet for buildings 
thirty-five (35) feet in height, and five (5) additional feet for each additional ten (10) feet in 
height.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balcony projections over property 
lines in district C-2:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In district C-2, balconies on 
new, renovated or retrofitted construction may project into 
the public right-of-way only if:</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement complies with section 
24-2(c) of this code; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balcony projects only over 
a public sidewalk or an alley, provided that such 
projection does not cause a disruption to any city service or maintenance of the underlying public 
improvements. No balcony shall project over the travel lanes of any public street; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum projection and minimum 
height above the public sidewalk shall be 
governed by the Building Code of Columbia, Missouri, adopted in chapter 6 of this code; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed 
balcony meets all applicable design standards contained in this code and 
other ordinances passed by the city council.</div>
