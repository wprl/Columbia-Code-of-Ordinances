<i>Powers and duties:</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board may, in appropriate 
cases and subject to appropriate conditions and 
safeguards, make special exceptions to the terms of this chapter in harmony with its general 
purpose and intent in accordance with general or specific rules herein contained.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board shall adopt rules in 
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Meetings 
of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may 
determine. Such chairman, or in his absence, the acting chairman, may administer oaths and 
compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. The 
board shall keep minutes of the proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each 
question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its 
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of 
the board and shall be a public record. All testimony, objections thereto, and rulings thereon shall 
be taken down by a reporter employed by the board for that purpose and who shall receive 
reasonable compensation for such from the city. The reporter shall furnish to any person or 
persons a transcript of all or part of such proceedings upon payment to him of a fee equal to that 
set forth in section 492.590(2), Revised Statutes of Missouri. The presence of four (4) members 
shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeals to the board may be taken 
by any person aggrieved, or by any officer, 
department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of an administrative official in 
the administration or enforcement of this chapter. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable 
time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is 
taken and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from 
whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the 
record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An applicant shall deposit a sum 
sufficient to pay the costs of advertising as required by statute and ordinance. The clerk shall 
inform applicants of the estimated cost of advertising and require a deposit sufficient to meet the 
costs upon filing. All unexpended portions of the deposit shall be returned after the actual costs 
of advertising have been met.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal stays all proceedings 
in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the 
officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal shall have 
been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, 
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise 
than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record, on 
application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board shall fix a reasonable 
time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice 
thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable 
time. At the hearing any party may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney.</div>
