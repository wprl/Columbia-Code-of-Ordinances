(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City staff shall prepare a report for the planning and zoning commission. &nbsp;The commission 
shall hold a public hearing on the scenic roadway designation request. The recommendations of 
the planning and zoning commission and the staff report shall be forwarded to the city council, 
which will conduct a public hearing to take action on the proposed designation.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Corridor Plan</i>. Following, and within ninety (90) days of designation, the planning and 
zoning commission shall initiate a corridor study and planning process, to identify existing 
conditions, estimate future land use and transportation infrastructure needs, and work with an 
appointed stakeholder advisory group to determine values and preferences regarding scenic 
preservation and roadway design within and along the corridor. &nbsp;The corridor plan shall result 
in 
the development of goals, objectives, policies and recommendations to guide future land use, 
transportation planning, and design decisions.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>The city council shall appoint a stakeholder advisory group of up to fifteen (15) 
members with 
the following composition:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-third (1/3) shall be residents who live along the 
affected scenic road corridor,

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Roadway Design</i>. Roadway design, including the design of proposed alterations and 
improvements as defined in subsection (i), shall be coordinated with the city&#146;s capital 
improvement project schedule and shall substantially conform to the adopted corridor plan. 
Public input shall be collected by the public works department during the design phase.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Timing</i>. &nbsp;Any improvements recommended by the corridor plan should be considered for 
inclusion in the city&#146;s capital improvement program, which is used to coordinate scheduling, 
funding, design, and construction of future capital projects, and is subject to council approval.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Consistency with corridor plan</i>. The design shall be consistent with the goals, objectives, 
policies, and recommendations of the corridor plan. Pedestrian and bicyclist facilities and access 
management shall also be considered in the roadway design, understanding that design options 
that are away from the road may need to be designed to preserve and enhance the scenic quality 
of the road.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholder advisory group</i>. &nbsp;The stakeholder advisory group shall 
weigh the level of 
service needs of all intended roadway users against S-R district preservation goals in proposing 
specific design options for the roadway. &nbsp;</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Modifications to city roadway design standards</i>. &nbsp;Modifications to the applicable roadway 
design standards should be considered to aid in preserving scenic characteristics of the roadway. 
&nbsp;The use of materials that blend into and complement the scenic characteristics of the roadway, 
including, but not limited to, stone and timber, should be used for bridges, guard rails, guideposts 
and other engineered structures, provided that they meet safety standards set forth in <i>The 
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Roadside Design Guide</i>. 
Scenic road curves should be retained as much as possible, speed limited, and no curve banking.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(5)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public involvement process</i>. &nbsp;Public involvement during the scenic 
roadway design phase 
shall consist of regular pre-design stakeholder input meetings, as needed, to fully address design 
issues, followed by at least one (1) additional stakeholder input meeting once a preliminary 
design has been completed by the public works department. &nbsp;Upon completion of a preliminary 
roadway design, city staff shall prepare a report for the planning and zoning commission. The 
commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed design. The recommendations of the 
planning and zoning commission and the staff report shall be forwarded to the city council, 
which will conduct a public hearing in accordance with the standard public improvement process 
set forth in chapter 22 and take action on the proposed roadway design.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Routine Maintenance</i>. The City shall maintain scenic roadways in good 
repair and in 
passable condition by routine maintenance. &nbsp;However, such routine maintenance shall be 
performed in a manner to protect and maintain the scenic characteristics of the roadway to the 
extent feasible.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>For the purposes of this section, the term &#147;routine maintenance&#148; shall 
include:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road cleaning, including removal of snow or other debris 
from the road surface.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removal of dead, seriously diseased or damaged trees and 
branches that pose a threat to 
public safety; trimming branches to allow school buses, emergency vehicles, and other vehicles 
to pass; (the corridor plan may prohibit larger vehicles from using the road or they may be 
limited by the city council to preserve the scenic quality of the road); trimming and removal of 
brush and removal of brush and removal of boulders and other obstacles that encroach on the 
traveled portion of the road or obstruct established site lines required for safety; necessary 
cutting and trimming of brush or trees for utility lines (as established in the corridor plan); and 
trimming of brush to enhance and protect scenic views, stone walls, mature trees, and other 
scenic characteristics of the scenic road as set forth in its designation.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correction of road drainage problems, including, but 
not limited to, the removal of 
trees, shrubs, silt and other material from existing drainage structures, and the replacement of 
cross culverts, drains and cross culvert drainage pipes. &nbsp;If correction of the problem involves 
removing the vegetative buffer, then this must come before the stakeholder advisory group for 
the group&#146;s approval and input.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graveling (or its equivalent) and grading to smooth the 
surface of unpaved roads, provided 
that the nature and characteristics of the material used on the road surface remains the same or 
the surface is restored to a prior passable condition using natural materials such as crushed rock 
or native stone or the equivalent.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repaving, retreatment, or repair of existing paved surfaces, 
curbs and gutters, that does not 
require the widening of the traveled path or the removal of trees or stone walls or changing the 
grade or configuration. &nbsp;For purposes of this subsection, &#147;widening of the traveled path&#148; 
means 
extending the traveled path beyond its width prior to repaving. &nbsp;Periodic edging out to maintain 
unpaved shoulders shall be considered routine maintenance if it does not remove the existing 
vegetative buffer.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repair or replacement of existing bridges, guard posts, 
rails and other engineered 
structures, in accordance with the corridor plan.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation of signs, including reflectors, warning, 
speed limit, and other roadway signs that 
are installed in accordance with standards set forth in the <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Manual on Uniform Traffic Control 
Devices</i>.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterations and Improvements</i>. &nbsp;Any proposed alteration or improvement 
to a scenic 
roadway shall follow the public involvement process for roadway design in subsection (g)(5) 
above. &nbsp;For the purposes of this section, the terms &#147;alteration&#148; and &#147;improvement&#148; 
are defined as 
any change to the roadway, other than routine maintenance, including the following:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change to the width of the traveled path of the right-of-way,</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change to the alignment, grade or elevation of the 
roadway,</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change to the nature and characteristics of the material 
used on the road surface,</div>
<br>
