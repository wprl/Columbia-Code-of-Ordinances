<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Purpose.</i> &nbsp;The purpose of this 
district is to enable innovation and flexibility in design

<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

a broad range of office uses might be 
inappropriate.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage development of such scale and character 
that it will be harmonious with 
surrounding areas and minimize any adverse impacts.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Permitted uses. In district O-P, no building, land or 
premises shall be used and no building 
shall be hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed or altered except for one or more of the uses 
allowed by the ordinance placing the property in District O-P (for exceptions, see section 29-28, 
nonconforming uses, and section 29-31, board of adjustment). The commission shall recommend

The first step in the approval process should be a concept review to discuss and

director of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">

development and the developer to discuss land use and development

<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The second step shall be the submission of a request for rezoning to O-P. &nbsp;Rezoning shall 
be done in accordance with Sec. 29-34 and shall be accompanied by a statement of intent. &nbsp;The 
statement of intent shall be a letter, signed by the applicant or his agent, containing the following

proposed development.</span></font></div>

<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The statement of intent shall become part of the ordinance approving the O-P zoning and shall be 
binding upon the owners, their heirs and assigns until such time as the council shall release such 
limitations on the use of the subject property under the procedures provided herein. &nbsp;The 
statement of intent is also intended to provide guidance for any future revisions to the O-P 
development plan.</span></font></div>

be given an opportunity to:</span></font></div>
