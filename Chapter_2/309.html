<i>Efficient use of resources.</i> One goal of the visioning implementation process is to 
promote the efficient utilization of resources, both monetary and nonmonetary, and both 
governmental and nongovernmental, in accomplishing identified goals. Boards and commissions 
who are assigned specific responsibilities in the visioning implementation report should, in 
furtherance of this goal, collaborate with other boards and commissions and with 
nongovernmental entities as needed to promote the efficient utilization of resources. </span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Transparency and citizen involvement.</i> The visioning process has been built on the 
principles of inclusiveness, transparency and openness. Boards and commissions who are 
assigned specific responsibilities in the visioning implementation report should, in furtherance of 
these principles, seek to engage the public in their work in a manner consistent with the 
guidelines for convening, management, and coordination of citizen groups that are included in 
the implementation report approved by the city council, as such report may be amended from 
time to time. </span></div>

<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Cooperation with Columbia Vision Commission.</i> Boards and commissions who are 
assigned specific responsibilities in the visioning implementation report should, in furtherance of 
those responsibilities, respond to requests for information that are made by the Columbia Vision 
Commission, and participate as requested by that commission in preparing recommendations for 
implementation tasks and in such public dialogues as may be convened relating to their 
responsibilities.</span></div>
