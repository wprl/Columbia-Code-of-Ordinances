<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
All public governmental bodies shall give notice of the time, date, and place of each 
meeting, and its tentative agenda, in a manner reasonably calculated to advise the public of the 
matters to be considered. If the meeting will be conducted by telephone or other electronic 
means, the notice of the meeting shall identify the mode by which the meeting will be conducted 
and the designated location where the public may observe and attend the meeting. If a public 
body plans to meet by Internet chat, Internet message board, or other computer link, it shall post 
a notice of the meeting on its website in addition to its principal office and shall notify the public 
how to access that meeting. Reasonable notice shall include making available copies of the 
notice to any representative of the news media who requests notice of meetings of a particular 
governmental body concurrent with the notice being made available to the members of the 
particular governmental body. Reasonable notice shall also include posting the notice on the 
bulletin board in the </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
first floor hallway of the City Hall Building</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
, 701 East Broadway and on a 
bulletin board or other prominent place which is easily accessible to the public and clearly 
designated for that purpose in the building in which the meeting is to be held.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Notice conforming with all of the requirements of subsection 2-25(a) shall 
be given at least 
twenty-four (24) hours, exclusive of weekends and holidays when the facility where the required 
notice is posted is closed, prior to the commencement of any meeting of a public governmental 
body unless, for good cause, such notice is impossible or impractical, in which case as much 
notice as is reasonably possible shall be given. Each meeting shall be held at a place reasonably 
accessible to the public and of sufficient size to accommodate the anticipated attendance by 
members of the public, and at a time reasonably convenient to the public, unless for good cause 
such a place or time is impossible or impractical. Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant 
special access to the meeting to handicapped or disabled individuals.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) When it is necessary to hold a meeting on less than twenty-four (24) hours' 
notice, or at a 
place that is not reasonably accessible to the public, or at a time that is not reasonably convenient 
to the public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the normal requirements 
shall be stated in the minutes.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) A formally constituted subunit of a parent public governmental body may 
conduct a 
meeting without notice as required by this section during a lawful meeting of the parent 
governmental body, a recess in that meeting, or immediately following that meeting, if the 
meeting of the subunit is publicly announced at the parent meeting and the subject of the meeting 
reasonably coincides with the subjects discussed or acted upon by the parent governmental body.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) If another provision of law requires a manner of giving specific notice 
of a meeting, 
hearing or an intent to take action by a governmental body, compliance with that section shall 
constitute compliance with the notice requirements of this section.</span></font></div>
