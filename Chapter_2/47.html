<p class=texthead>Section 2-47 Consent agenda procedure.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager may, at his discretion, place any item of 
business on the consent agenda, 
provided the item of business does not involve any advertised public hearing, does not require a 
super majority vote, and as to which no request has been made by a city council member or other 
person to discuss the matter. The consent agenda shall be prepared by the city manager. An item 
of business placed on the consent agenda may be removed from such agenda at any time prior to 
the finalization of the consent agenda as set forth in section 2-46 of this chapter. An item of 
business shall be automatically removed from the consent agenda if a request is made by a 
council member or a citizen that they wish to speak or have discussion on the matter. An item 
included on the consent agenda shall not be debated or discussed by city council members nor 
shall any person have a right to speak on said matter unless the person has requested an 
opportunity to speak on the matter prior to the finalization of the consent agenda. Items of 
business contained on the consent agenda shall be voted upon by council considering the consent 
agenda in its entirety and shall not be taken up for consideration as separate matters, except that 
nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit a city council member from voting 
individually on each separate item shown on the consent agenda.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vote by a city council member for adoption of the consent 
agenda shall mean that the 
council member has requested that his vote be recorded as an aye vote for each separate item on 
the consent agenda and shall be recorded as such. A vote against adoption of the consent agenda 
shall be recorded as a nay vote on each item placed on the consent agenda and shall be recorded 
as such. Provided, however, a city council member, when casting an aye vote or nay vote, may 
specifically exclude from such vote for approval or disapproval of the consent agenda specific 
items on the agenda, and in such event the city clerk shall record the exceptions accordingly.</div>
