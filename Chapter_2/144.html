<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing on the first day of the month following the date 
of the approval of the plan and 
agreement of the city by the state agency, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated from the 
general revenue fund and from the water and light fund of the city, and there is, and shall be, 
appropriated, the sum of money necessary to pay the contributions of the city which shall be due 
and payable by virtue of the extension of the benefits of the Federal Old Age and Survivors' 
Insurance System to the eligible employees and officials of the city, such sum of money to be 
paid into the contributions fund created by Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 3 of 
the 66th General Assembly of the State of Missouri; provided, however, that in making the first 
payment to such contributions funds, after the benefits of such system have been extended to 
such employees and officials, such first payment shall include a sum equal to the amount which 
would have been due and payable had such extension of benefits been provided and effective on 
January 1, 1951. The fund from which such appropriation is made shall, at all times, be sufficient 
to pay the contributions of the city by this section directed to be paid to the contributions fund.</div>
