&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city's self-insurance program covers the following loses and claims: workers' 
compensation, automobile and property damage, automobile liability, public officials' liability 
and general liability for which sovereign immunity does not exist. The scope of workers' 
compensation coverage is governed by applicable state statutes. The scope of all other self-insurance 
program coverage is limited to the types of claims and losses covered by the city's most 
recent excess insurance policies. However, a noncontractual monetary claim against the city 
excluded from an excess insurance policy may be included by the city manager in the self-insurance plan.</span></font></div>
