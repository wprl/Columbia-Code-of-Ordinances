<p class=texthead>Section 2-47.1 Agenda preparation.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The city manager shall prepare the agenda for council 
meetings in accordance with the 
provisions of the Charter and ordinance. He shall place such matters upon the agenda as may be 
requested by any council person and those which he presents as head of city administration.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the event that any matter requested by any council 
person to be presented to the council 
in the form of a report, ordinance or resolution requires the expenditures of significant staff time 
or of public monies over and above those costs inherent in the administration of city government, 
the city manager shall inform the council person. The council person shall present such request 
to the council in the form of a motion to instruct the city manager and staff to prepare such 
report, ordinance or resolution.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Suggestions from city boards and commissions for staff 
reports, ordinances or resolutions 
shall be presented to the council in the form of a report. Neither staff time nor public monies 
shall be expended in the preparation of any staff report, ordinance or resolution until the council 
has by motion instructed the city manager and staff to prepare such document or, in the instance 
of an ordinance or resolution which does not require significant staff time, until a council person 
has requested such preparation. Any action which may be initiated by any board or commission 
pursuant to authority granted by the charter, ordinance or statute is specifically exempted from 
this requirement.</div>
