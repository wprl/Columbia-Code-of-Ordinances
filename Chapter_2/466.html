<p class=texthead>Section 2-466 Bidding process; contracts for $15,000 or more.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Except as otherwise provided in this article, the purchasing 
agent shall not contract for the 
purchase of any supplies, materials, equipment or services costing $15,000 or more unless the 
bidding process of this section has been followed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent shall advertise 
for sealed bids in a newspaper of general circulation 
in the city at least five days before the time set for opening bids. &nbsp;All bids must be sealed and 
addressed to the purchasing division and must be received by the purchasing division by 2 
o&#146;clock p.m. on the day specified in the advertisement for bids. &nbsp;The bids shall be opened 
by the 
purchasing agent at the purchasing agent&#146;s office between 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. on the day the 
bids are due, if practicable. &nbsp;If not practicable, then the bids shall be opened on the earliest 
day 
thereafter that the purchasing agent is able to open the bids. &nbsp;The purchasing agent may require 
bidders to deposit a cashier&#146;s check or a certified check drawn on a solvent financial institution 
or a surety bond in an amount not less than 5 percent of the bid. &nbsp;The deposit shall be forfeited 
to 
the city if the successful bidder fails or refuses to execute the contract.</div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent may use an electronic 
bidding system if the system is secure and 
allows the bids to be opened only at the time designated for bid opening.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent, after consulting 
with all affected departments and subject to the 
provisions of subsection (e), may reject any or all bids, may award the contract to the bidder that 
is, in the judgment of the purchasing agent, the lowest and best, responsive and responsible 
bidder, or may split the award between two or more bidders if, in the judgment of the purchasing 
agent, it is in the best interest of the City to split the award.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before taking any action on bids, 
the purchasing agent shall inform all affected 
departments of the purchasing agent&#146;s proposed action. &nbsp;The head of any affected department 
who disagrees with the purchasing agent&#146;s proposed action may inform the purchasing agent and 
the head of any other affected department of the disagreement. &nbsp;If, after conferring on the matter, 
the purchasing agent and the heads of all affected departments are unable to agree on an 
appropriate action on the bids, the matter shall be referred to the city manager for final decision.</div>
