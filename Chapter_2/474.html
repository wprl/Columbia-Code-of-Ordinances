<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent is authorized 
to debar a person from consideration for award of 
contracts for any of the following reasons:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conviction of a criminal offense 
as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a 
public or private contract or subcontract, or in the performance of such contract or subcontract.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conviction under state or federal 
statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, 
falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property, or any other offense indicating 
a 
lack of integrity or honesty which currently, seriously and directly affects responsibility as a city 
contractor or vendor.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conviction under state or federal 
antitrust statutes arising out of the submission of bids or 
proposals.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberate failure without good cause 
to perform in accordance with contract 
specifications or within the time limit provided in the contract.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent record of failure to perform 
or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with 
the terms of one (1) or more contracts; provided that failure to perform or unsatisfactory 
performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor or vendor shall not be 
considered a basis for debarment.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is in arrears on any debt 
owed the city or has a history of being chronically in 
arrears on debts owed the city.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other cause so serious and compelling 
as to affect responsibility as a city contractor 
or vendor, including debarment by another governmental entity for any cause listed in this 
article.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of debarment shall not 
exceed three (3) years.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent shall initiate 
a debarment by serving written notice of the 
debarment to the person the purchasing agent intends to debar. &nbsp;The notice shall set forth the 
specific grounds for the debarment and advise the person of the right to appeal. &nbsp;The notice shall 
be served by registered or certified mail or by delivering a copy of the notice to the person 
subject to debarment or the person&#146;s agent or employee. &nbsp;The debarment shall take effect ten 
(10) 
days after service of the notice unless an appeal is taken to the director of finance. &nbsp;If an appeal 
is 
taken, the debarment shall not take effect until a final order upholding the debarment is entered 
by the director or until the appeal is dismissed by the appellant.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days after service 
of a written notice of debarment, the person affected 
by the notice may file a written request for a hearing before &nbsp;the director of finance contesting 
the 
debarment.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director of finance shall set 
the matter for hearing on the record within thirty (30) 
days of the receipt of a request for a hearing. &nbsp;At least ten (10) days notice of the hearing shall 
be 
given to the affected person and to the purchasing agent.</div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing, each party shall 
have the right to call and examine witnesses, introduce 
exhibits, cross-examine opposing witnesses and impeach any witness. &nbsp;Oral evidence shall be 
taken on oath or affirmation. &nbsp;All evidence shall be suitably recorded and preserved. &nbsp;The 
technical rules of evidence shall not apply, but the director may exclude evidence which is 
irrelevant or repetitious. &nbsp;Each party shall be entitled to present oral arguments or written briefs 
at or after the hearing.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) working days of receipt 
of the transcript of the hearing, the director of 
finance shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue a final order. 
Findings of fact shall be based upon competent and substantial evidence found in the record as a 
whole. &nbsp;A copy of the director&#146;s order, findings of fact and conclusions of law, shall be 
delivered 
or mailed to the purchasing agent and to the affected person.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal from the director&#146;s 
order shall be to the circuit court pursuant to chapter 536, 
RSMo.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section shall 
limit the authority of the purchasing agent to accept the bid 
which in the judgment of the purchasing agent is the lowest and best bid, or to reject any or all 
bids or to reject a bid on grounds which could have been used to debar the bidder.</div>
