<p class=texthead>Section 2-87 Reconsideration of bill.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) When a bill which does not involve an advertised public 
hearing is put upon its final 
passage and fails to pass, a motion to reconsider may be made by a council member voting on the 
prevailing side, i.e., for defeat of the ordinance, at any time during the council meeting when the 
original vote was taken. When such motion to reconsider is made, the vote on such motion shall 
be immediately taken, and if such motion prevails, a vote on the bill shall be taken and the 
subject finally disposed of or tabled to a subsequent meeting before the council proceeds to any 
other business.</div>

the council recesses or proceeds to any other business, the reconsideration shall be governed by 
the provisions of section 2-88 relating to reconsideration of subject matter.</div>
