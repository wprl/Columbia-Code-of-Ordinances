<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
Except as otherwise provided in this article, all contracts for purchases of supplies, 
materials, equipment and services which have not been specifically authorized by the city council 
shall be entered into only after a competitive bidding process or a request for proposals process.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent may enter into 
contracts for emergency purchases without 
following a competitive bidding process or a request for proposals process. &nbsp;&#147;Emergency 
purchases&#148; are purchases necessitated by nonrecurring emergency situations posing a substantial 
danger to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens or of a risk of substantial financial loss 
to 
the city unless the required supplies, materials, equipment or services are obtained as 
expeditiously as possible. &nbsp;The department head requesting an emergency purchase shall certify 
that the purchase is an emergency within the meaning of this section by a memorandum which 
sets forth the nature of the emergency. &nbsp;If the purchasing agent and the department head do not 
agree that the proposed purchase is an emergency purchase, the matter shall be referred to the 
city manager for final decision.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent may enter into 
contracts with sole source suppliers and 
governmental entities without following a competitive bidding process or a request for proposals 
process. &nbsp;&#147;Sole source suppliers&#148; are suppliers of supplies, materials, equipment or 
services 
which are unique or which are not available from more than one competitive source in the 
normal course of business. &nbsp;The purchasing agent shall certify in writing that each purchase from 
a sole source supplier under this subsection meets the requirements of this subsection.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager may enter into 
contracts for professional and other services without 
following a competitive bidding process or a request for proposals process when factors such as 
prior experience, skills, education, local knowledge or unique knowledge are considerations in 
selecting the contractor.<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager may waive attorney conflicts of interest if the 
manager determines that the waiver is in the City&#146;s interest.</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;This subsection shall not apply to 
contracts for auditing services for the annual fiscal audit or to contracts for architectural, 
engineering and land surveying services.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchasing agent may enter into 
contracts for specialized services relating to art 
conservation, restoration, archiving and installation without following a competitive bidding 
process or a request for proposals process when the required services are not widely available 
and when factors such as experience and local knowledge play an important role. &nbsp;The 
department head requesting these services shall document and certify that the proposed contract 
meets the requirements of this subsection.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager and purchasing 
agent are encouraged to pursue informal bidding and 
requests for proposals in the above categories of exceptions whenever time and business 
conditions permit.</div>
