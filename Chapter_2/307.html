<p class=texthead>Section 2-307 Conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote public trust 
in the impartiality and independence of the vision 
commission, members of the commission should avoid conflicts of interest as defined below and 
the appearance of conflicts of interest. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conflict of interest may exist 
when the current personal, financial, or professional 
interests or activities of a member of the commission could reasonably be viewed as competing 
with the interests or activities of the commission, and particularly when the member or their 
immediate families or an organization owned or controlled by such member or their immediate 
families could derive a financial or other material gain arising out of action by the commission. 
When there is doubt as to whether a conflict of interest exists, the matter shall be resolved by a 
vote of the commission, excluding the person that is the subject of the potential conflict. For 
purposes of this section &quot;personal interest&quot; means a more than nominal interest arising from 
family; close business, political or other associations; location of property owned by a member; 
or other factor likely to affect the welfare of the member or the member's family or close 
associate; and is something more than a well known opinion, or interest in, or academic study of, 
a subject matter. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any conflict of interest relates 
to a matter requiring action by the commission, the 
interested person shall call it to the attention of the commission and such interested person shall 
not vote on any question or matter in which that board member has a financial interest or a 
personal interest. Such person may, however, be counted in determining the presence of a 
quorum for a vote. Unless requested to remain present during the meeting, the interested person 
shall retire from the room when the commission is voting on the matter related to the conflict and 
shall not participate in the final deliberation or decision regarding the matter under consideration, 
but shall provide the commission with any relevant information on the matter before retiring. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minutes of the meeting of the 
commission shall reflect that a conflict of interest was 
disclosed and that the interested person was not present during the final discussion or vote and 
did not vote. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of this conflict policy shall 
be provided to each member of the coordinating 
committee or resource member at the beginning of each calendar year. The commission may 
adopt other procedures and guidelines, not inconsistent with the above to ensure the 
independence of commission members and the confidence of the public in its impartiality. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No member of the commission shall 
intentionally use or disclose confidential information 
that is received by the commission in a way that could result in anything of value for such 
member, the member's family, or other person or organization with which such member is 
affiliated, unless the information has already been communicated to the general public or entered 
into the public record. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the commission determines that 
a member has failed to disclose a conflict of interest 
and voted on a matter affected by such conflict of interest, or has otherwise violated this conflict 
of interest policy, then such member shall forfeit the office. Any claim that this policy has been 
violated shall be raised within a year of the date of the vote or alleged violation.</div>
