<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of recycled product may 
exceed by up to ten (10) percent the lowest priced bid 
on a comparable product which does not utilize recycled materials.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of an environmentally preferable 
product may exceed by up to five (5) percent 
the lowest priced bid on a comparable product which is not environmentally preferable.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to qualify for recycled 
consideration on paper and paper products, proposed 
stock must meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommended minimum content 
standards of selected papers and paper products. &nbsp;Standards identifying the minimum content of 
recovered materials and products other than paper products shall be done on a case by case basis. 
The purchasing division shall utilize standards established by industry organizations, federal 
agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, nationally recognized standards 
organizations such as the American Society for Testing and Materials and state agencies.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bidders who wish to receive a 
preference on products made with recycled materials 
must properly complete, sign and return with their bid a certification of product content.</div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager is authorized 
to designate certain post consumer recycled materials for 
use in city projects to demonstrate and encourage the use of these products. &nbsp;Wherever possible, 
markers shall be erected listing the recycled content of the products. &nbsp;These products shall not 
exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) annually.</div>
