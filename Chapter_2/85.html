<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bill introduced shall be filed with the city clerk 
on the day of its first reading and shall 
remain on file in his office for public inspection until it is finally adopted or fails of passage. 
Prior to the final passage of any bill, other than an emergency bill, all persons interested therein 
shall be given an opportunity to be heard before the council, in accordance with such rules and 
regulations as the council may adopt. After the third reading of any bill and compliance with the 
other provisions herein, the council may finally pass the bill with or without amendment, except 
that if the council shall make an amendment which constitutes a change in substance, the bill as 
amended shall be filed in the office of the city clerk for one additional week, and an opportunity 
afforded for further public hearing, after which final action may be taken thereon.</div>
