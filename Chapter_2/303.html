<p class=texthead>Section 2-303 Duties; staff liaison. </p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission shall have the following duties and authority: </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Tracking measuring and reporting.</i> The commission shall conduct periodic reviews and, 
beginning in December 2009, issue an annual report on the progress of visioning implementation 
to the community. This report shall also include a summary and analysis of the commission's 
own efforts in the areas set forth below. The commission shall, by March 31, 2009, select an 
initial reporting format and identify the information to be tracked and included in such report. 
The annual progress report shall be provided to the city council and made available to the public. </span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Coordination with other governmental boards, commissions, departments and 
nongovernmental entities.</i> The commission shall have the authority to solicit the cooperation of 
other boards and commissions in the city and throughout the region as needed to assist with its 
reporting and other duties, and also to solicit and receive information from other entities involved 
in visioning implementation. </span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Recommendation of implementation tasks.</i> Beginning one year after the city council's 
approval of the initial implementation report as provided in section 2-533, and every two years 
thereafter, the commission shall, after seeking the input of other city boards, commissions, and 
departments, recommend implementation tasks to be undertaken over the two years following the 
period covered in the then effective implementation report, and the additional resources needed 
to accomplish such tasks. In preparing these recommendations, the commission shall also 
coordinate with other relevant boards and commissions, including the Boone County 
Commission, and with the city manager's office. A discussion draft of the commission's 
recommendations should be (i) posted for public comment for at least thirty (30) days, (ii) 
revised as may be appropriate to incorporate comments received, and (iii) included in the 
progress report provided for in subsection (a). </span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Public education and outreach.</i> The commission should offer public programs on the 
visioning process, track the groups involved in various implementation tasks, and work to recruit 
a diverse participant base in such tasks. The commission may, as independent resources become 
available, either on its own or in conjunction with others, operate a website that is separate from 
the city website for the purposes of public education, outreach and engagement. </span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Convening of public dialogues.</i> The commission shall convene community-wide 
dialogues at five-year intervals, beginning in 2014, to review the vision and the progress being 
made in implementation. These dialogues shall be structured in a way that is consistent with the 
principles of inclusiveness and transparency. The commission may in its discretion also convene 
dialogues to address conflicts that arise within the community over implementation of different 
goals or strategies, including disputes that arise over the allocation of scarce resources. The 
commission may request that the city hire facilitators to help with such dialogues. </span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Fundraising and administration.</i> The commission shall have the authority to seek grants 
and other funds to be used to offset the costs of its work and to aid in the administration of 
visioning implementation efforts by citizen and other groups. The city shall serve as the fiscal 
agent for any such funds. </span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Incidental authority.</i> The commission shall have such other authority as may be assigned 
by the city council from time to time and shall act in an advisory capacity in making 
recommendations to improve the ongoing process of visioning implementation. </span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Staff liaison.</i> The city manager shall appoint a staff liaison to work with the commission.</span></div>
