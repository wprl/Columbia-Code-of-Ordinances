<p>
<body>
<div align=left><span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visioning</i> refers to the process that (i) began as &quot;Imagine Columbia's 
Future,&quot; (ii) resulted in 
the preparation of the final vision report which was accepted by the city council on February 4, 
2008, and (iii) is continuing with the ongoing implementation of the vision set forth in that 
report. As is recognized in the final vision report, visioning is a continuing and evolving process 
where information in the final vision report is integrated with other ongoing activities within the 
community, new information is obtained, and new people become involved. The vision and goal 
statements in the final vision report will, however, serve to both inform the changes to be made 
and set a standard against which the outcomes of various changes can be measured.</span></div>
