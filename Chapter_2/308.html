<p class=texthead>Section 2-308 Visioning implementation. </p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office of the city manager shall 
complete the process of developing the initial draft 
implementation report that was provided for in the final vision report and shall present a draft of 
that report to the city council for review on or before March 31, 2009. Drafts of the 
implementation report that are posted on the city's website for public comment prior to that date 
shall also be forwarded to members of the city council for their review and comment. The city 
council's review and approval of that report will be scheduled to coincide with the city council's 
review and approval of the budget for the following fiscal year. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approval of the initial implementation 
reports, the preparation of periodic updates, 
including periods of public comment, should be scheduled so that any update is received by the 
city council on or before March 31 of the applicable year which will allow for the review and 
approval of such update to be coordinated with the city's budgeting process. Copies of drafts of 
updates to the implementation report that are presented for public comment shall also be 
provided to members of the city council for their review and comment at the same time as they 
are presented to the public for comment. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council acknowledges that visioning 
implementation has already begun and does not 
intend by setting the above timeline to delay or defer actions being taken to implement visioning 
by existing boards, commissions, departments, or other entities. Such actions are encouraged and 
boards and commissions that make recommendations for council action both prior to and 
following approval of the draft implementation report are encouraged to provide explanations of 
how visioning guided or influenced such recommendations.</div>
