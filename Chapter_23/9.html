<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Application.</i> The owner or lessee of the premises upon which a sign is to be erected may 
file an application with the board of adjustment for approval of a sign plan upon forms provided 
by the city, except if the proposed sign locations(s) is within a planned zoning district. Revisions 
to such sign plans in planned districts shall be made, subject to the procedures outlined in section 
23-25(j). The application shall be accompanied by a sketch showing the type, size and location of 
the signs proposed to be erected upon the property or premises. Sign plans for planned zoning 
districts approved prior to December 16, 1991, shall remain in effect.</span></div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Approval of variance.</i> The board of adjustment may approve such a plan allowing a 
variance in the number or particular type of sign otherwise permitted by this ordinance provided 
that:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unlawful signs shall be permitted.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All nonconforming signs on the 
property or premises shall be brought into compliance 
with the requirements of this chapter.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each sign meets the size, setback 
and other limitations and requirements for that type or 
class of sign.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board of adjustment finds 
that the plan:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduces 
the number of signs which would otherwise be permitted on the premises or 
property;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduces 
the total square footage of signs which would otherwise be permitted on said 
property; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would not 
violate the spirit or intent of this chapter.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No permit shall be issued for 
erection of a sign on premises or property on which such a 
plan has been approved, where the sign does not conform with the requirements of the plan, 
without the removal at the applicant's expense of all signs permitted by the plan and not 
otherwise permitted.</div>
