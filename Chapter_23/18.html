<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall be ground or wall signs, 
except when placed in a location where other types of 
signs are allowed.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall not exceed sixteen 
(16) square feet in sign surface area per premises; 
provided, that any noncommercial sign may have a sign surface area as large as that of any 
allowable sign in the same location.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall not exceed a maximum 
height of ten (10) feet; provided, that any 
noncommercial sign may be as high as any allowable sign in the same location.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area and height limitations 
of this section shall not apply to any noncommercial 
message placed on a structure that has existed as a nonconforming billboard.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any structure which may be lawfully
