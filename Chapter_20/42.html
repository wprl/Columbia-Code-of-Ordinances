&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The commission may recommend to the council such amendments or revisions 
to Chapter 
29 of this Code as the commission shall deem necessary or desirable for the promotion of the 
health, safety, morals and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city. Such provisions may 
include regulations as to the location, width, height, and bulk of buildings; the size of yards, 
courts, and other open spaces surrounding buildings; and the use of buildings and land. The 
commission shall hear applications for amendments, modifications or revisions of the zoning 
ordinance and shall forward such applications to the council with its recommendations thereon. 
The recommendations of the commission shall not be binding upon the council, which may 
approve or disapprove the commission's findings; however, no plan, no zoning ordinance, nor 
any modification, amendment or revision thereof, shall be finally considered by the council 
unless the same shall have been first submitted to the commission for its examination and 
recommendation.</span></font></div>
