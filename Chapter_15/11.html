<p class=texthead>Section 15-11 Trial by jury.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Any person charged with the violation of a municipal 
ordinance shall be entitled to a trial 
by jury, as in prosecutions for misdemeanors before an associate circuit judge.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Whenever a defendant accused of a violation of a municipal 
ordinance has the right to a 
trial by jury and demands such trial by jury, the municipal judge shall certify the case to the 
presiding judge of the circuit court serving the city for assignment in the manner provided by 
state law. Proceedings in the case shall be had as if the case was originally commenced under the 
practice and procedure applicable before circuit judges with there being no right of trial de novo; 
but the sufficiency of plaintiff's petition shall be adjudged according to the procedures under 
chapter 517, RSMo.</div>
