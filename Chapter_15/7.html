<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The municipal judge shall have authority to issue search 
warrants for searches or 
inspections to determine the existence of violations of &nbsp;any of the provisions of the Code of 
Ordinances. The municipal judge shall also have authority to issue warrants for the entry onto 
property to seize property or to otherwise enforce any of the provisions of the Code of 
Ordinances.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Warrants and searches or inspections made pursuant thereto 
shall conform to and be 
governed by the following provisions:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any police officer, deputy, code 
enforcement official or prosecuting attorney of the city 
may make application for the issuance of a warrant.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application shall:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be in writing;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State the 
time and date of the making of the application;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify 
the property or places to be entered, searched or seized in sufficient detail and 
particularity that the officer executing the warrant can readily ascertain it;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State facts 
sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant to 
search for violations of this Code of Ordinances or to show that entry or seizure is authorized by 
this Code and that due process has been afforded prior to the entry or seizure;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be verified 
by the oath or affirmation of the applicant; and</div>

in the municipal division of the Boone County, Missouri, Circuit Court.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application shall be supplemented 
by written affidavits verified by oath or 
affirmation. Such affidavits shall be considered in determining whether there is probable cause 
for the issuance of the warrant and in filling out any deficiencies in the description of the 
property or places to be entered or searched. Oral testimony shall not be considered.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge shall hold a nonadversary 
hearing to determine whether sufficient facts have 
been stated to justify the issuance of a warrant. If it appears from the application and any 
supporting affidavits that there is probable cause to inspect or search for violations of this Code, 
or that entry or seizure is authorized by this Code, a warrant shall immediately be issued to allow 
such search, entry or seizure. The warrant shall be issued in the form of an original and two (2) 
copies.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application and any supporting 
affidavits and a copy of the warrant shall be retained 
in the records of the municipal judge.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrant shall:</div>

and in the name of the issuing authority;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be directed 
to any police officer or deputy in the city;</div>
<br>

time and date the warrant is issued;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify 
the property or places to be searched, entered or seized in sufficient detail and 
particularity that the officer executing the warrant can readily ascertain it;</div>
