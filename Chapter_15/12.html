<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Summons; oral notification.</i> It shall be the duty of the municipal judge to summon all 
persons whose testimony may be deemed essential as witnesses at the trial, and to enforce their 
attendance by attachment, if necessary. The fees of witnesses shall be the same as those fixed for 
witnesses in trials before associate circuit judges and shall be taxed as other costs in the case. 
When a trial shall be continued by a municipal judge it shall not be necessary to summon any 
witnesses who may be present at the continuance; but the municipal judge shall orally notify 
such witnesses as either party may require to attend before him on the day set for trial to testify 
in the case, and enter the names of such witnesses on his docket, which oral notice shall be valid 
as a summons.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Policeman or other officer as witness.</i> In prosecutions before the municipal judge for 
misdemeanors arising under ordinances of the city, any policeman or other executive officer shall 
be a competent witness in the case but no such policeman or executive officer shall be entitled to 
any witness fee in such case.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Arresting officers to attend as witnesses without summons.</i> Officers shall attend, upon 
notice, as witnesses against persons whom they have caused to be arrested, without being 
summoned to do so; and, upon their failure to appear at the time of the trial, may be attached and 
punished for contempt as witnesses summoned.</span></div>
