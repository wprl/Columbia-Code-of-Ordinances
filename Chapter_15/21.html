<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city counselor may, when he is not satisfied that the 
information is made for the purpose 
of public justice, or that the evidence is sufficient to obtain the conviction of the accused, require 
the prosecuting witness to deposit with the municipal court a sufficient amount of money for the 
payment of all costs that may accrue, or else, give bond and security for the costs; and in such 
case, if the accused by acquitted, the court shall render judgment against the prosecuting witness 
for costs.</div>
