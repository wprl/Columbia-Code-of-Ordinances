<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interested parties meeting. &nbsp;Except 
as otherwise provided in this code, formal 
proceedings for public improvements shall begin by appropriate city staff holding at least one 
meeting with interested parties to explain the basic concept of the proposed project and receive 
comments and suggestions. &nbsp;City staff shall make reasonable efforts to notify those most likely 
to 
be interested in or affected by the project, of the time and place of the interested parties meeting. 
Staff, when feasible shall attempt to personally contact by telephone or in person, the owners of 
property abutting the proposed public improvement to advise the property owners of the nature 
of the proposed improvement and the time and place of the interested parties meeting.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution of necessity. &nbsp;Following 
the interested parties meeting, the city council, if it 
determines to proceed with the project, shall adopt a resolution declaring the necessity of the 
improvement. &nbsp;The resolution shall describe the improvement, state the estimated cost of the 
improvement, state the method of payment for the improvement, and set a public hearing on the 
improvement. &nbsp;Notice of the public hearing shall be published at least once in a newspaper of 
general circulation in the city. &nbsp;Notice shall be published at least seven days before the hearing. 
Staff, when feasible shall attempt to personally contact by telephone or in person, the owners of 
property abutting the proposed public improvement to advise the property owners of the time and 
place of the public hearing.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public hearing. &nbsp;At the public 
hearing on a public improvement project, all interested 
persons shall be given an opportunity to be heard. &nbsp;After the hearing, the council shall determine 
whether it is in the public interest to make the public improvement or any part of the 
improvement. &nbsp;If the council determines that the public improvement or any part of it should be 
made, the council, by motion, shall direct the city manager to proceed with having plans and 
specifications prepared. &nbsp;If plans and specifications have already been prepared and made 
available at an interested parties meeting, the council may determine to proceed with the project 
as set forth in subsection (e) of this section. &nbsp;If any part of the project cost is to be paid 
for by 
special assessments, the city clerk shall record a notice with the Boone County Recorder of 
Deeds. This notice shall contain the following information:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief description of the 
improvement;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal descriptions of the 
properties which may be specially assessed;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Names of the property owners;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated amount of the 
special assessment; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement that when assessed, 
the special assessment shall be on file with the director of 
finance of the City of Columbia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisition of property. &nbsp;If 
the public improvement project requires the acquisition of 
any interest in real property, an ordinance authorizing such acquisition by negotiation or by the 
exercise of the power of eminent domain shall normally be passed following the city council&#146;s 
determination to proceed with the project.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid call ordinance. &nbsp;If the 
city council determines to proceed with the project, it shall, by 
ordinance, approve plans and specifications for the improvement and authorize the project to be 
constructed. &nbsp;The ordinance shall authorize the project to be constructed using city employees, 
or 
authorize the purchasing agent to call for bids and execute a contract for the improvement, or 
authorize part of the project to be constructed by city employees and part to be bid by the 
purchasing agent. &nbsp;The ordinance shall specify how the improvement shall be paid for. &nbsp;If 
any 
portion of the project is to be paid for by special assessments, the ordinance authorizing making 
the public improvement shall specify the portion of the project to be paid for by special 
assessments and identify the property to be assessed.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding. &nbsp;The purchasing 
agent shall advertise for bids in the same manner as bids for 
supplies, material, equipment or services are advertised under chapter 2 of this code. &nbsp;The 
advertisement shall advise bidders that the city reserves the rights to reject any and all bids. &nbsp;All 
bids shall be accompanied by a certified check or bid bond with corporate surety, satisfactory to 
the purchasing agent, for five percent (5%) of the amount of the bid. &nbsp;Bids submitted without 
such check or bid bond shall not be considered.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract. &nbsp;The purchasing 
agent may reject any or all bids or may award the contract to 
the bidder that is, in the judgment of the purchasing agent, the lowest and best bidder.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonds. &nbsp;The contractor on 
a public improvement project costing more than twenty-five 
thousand dollars ($25,000.00) shall give to the city performance and payment bonds, with 
corporate surety, satisfactory to the purchasing agent, each in an amount not less than the 
contract price. </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptance of improvement. &nbsp;When 
the improvement has been completed, the city 
official charged with responsibility for the improvement shall report to the city manager whether 
the work has been completed according to the contract, plans and specifications. &nbsp;Upon 
determining that the improvement has been properly completed, the city manager shall accept 
and approve the work.</div>
