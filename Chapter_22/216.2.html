<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where the director determines that wastes may be 
deleterious to the POTW or have an 
adverse effect upon the wastewater treatment process or the receiving stream, or body of water, 
the director may require treatment to reduce the total suspended solids, BOD or other 
constituents to levels more closely approaching those of normal wastewater before discharging 
such wastes into the city sewers. The director may also require any contributor to control its 
discharge to the public sewers so that it will not exceed a maximum percentage of the total flow 
in a sewer or to a treatment facility.</div>
