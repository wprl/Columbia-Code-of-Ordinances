<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general sewer system shall be composed of four (4) classes 
of sewers, to wit: public, 
district, joint district, and private sewers. The determination as to the class to which any sewer 
belongs shall be made without regard to the area drained, the size, character or purpose thereof. 
All public, district and joint district sewers shall be constructed along streets, alleys and other 
public ways wherever practicable; and no such sewer shall be built or acquired by the city, unless 
it is on a public way or right-of-way owned by the city. Such sewers may be connected with any 
other sewer of any class or with a natural course of drainage.</div>
