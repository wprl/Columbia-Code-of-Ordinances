<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shall incur no liability for building district sewers 
or joint sewers other than in the 
manner provided in section 22-243 or section 22-253 hereof, except when the city is the owner of 
a plot of ground within the district or joint sewer district, and in that case the city shall be liable 
for the cost of such sewer in the same manner as other property owners within the district. If any 
district or joint sewer shall drain territory lying outside the city limits and not included in the 
district or joint district, the city shall pay that part of the cost of such sewer as would have been 
assessed against such territory if it were included in the district or joint district.</div>
