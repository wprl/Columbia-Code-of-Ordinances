<p class=texthead>Section 22-217.2 Abatement financial assistance program.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abatement financial assistance 
program is hereby established. &nbsp;Under the program, 
the city will enter into financial assistance agreements with responsible parties that have been 
served with notices of violation under this article. &nbsp;Under these agreements, the city will abate 
the violations and the responsible parties will reimburse the city for the cost of abatement plus 
interest at four percent (4%) per annum.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A financial assistance agreement 
may provide that less than the total amount of the city&#146;s 
cost of abatement be reimbursed. &nbsp;The reduced amount of reimbursement may be a set percentage 
of the total abatement cost or a set amount.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A financial assistance agreement 
shall provide that monthly reimbursement amounts shall 
be charged to the utility account of the responsible party. &nbsp;If the responsible party does not 
have a 
utility account with the city, an alternate payment plan may be arranged.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director may set priorities 
for the program by type of abatement.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abatement financial assistance 
program shall be limited to projects costing ten 
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or less.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager is authorized 
to establish rules and regulations for the program that are 
consistent with the provisions of this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds, the city manager is authorized to 
execute, on behalf of the city, financial assistance agreements and agreements with third parties 
to abate violations.</div>
