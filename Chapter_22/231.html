<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District sewers are those which have been or may be constructed 
or acquired, under authority 
of ordinance, within the limits of an established sewer district, and paid for in whole or in part by 
special tax bills evidencing special assessments upon the property in the district. District sewers 
shall be established within the limits of the districts prescribed by ordinance, and shall connect 
with public sewers or other district sewers and may be constructed with the main branch or 
discharge pipe wholly within or beyond the boundary of the district, as the council shall 
determine. Such district may be subdivided, enlarged or changed by ordinance at any time 
previous to the construction of the sewers therein; and more than one district sewer may be laid 
in a sewer district if deemed necessary by the council for sanitary or other purposes. The council 
shall cause sewers to be constructed in each district whenever a majority of the resident property 
owners therein shall petition therefor or whenever the council shall deem such sewers necessary 
for sanitary or other purposes.</div>
