<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Wastes which are unusual in composition, i.e., contain an extremely large 
amount of total 
suspended solids or BOD; are high in dissolved solids such as sodium chloride, calcium chloride, 
or sodium sulfate; or are in any other way unusual, shall be reviewed by the director, who will 
determine whether such wastes shall be prohibited from or may be admitted to the city sewers or 
shall be modified or treated before being admitted. Wastes which, in the opinion of the director, 
are unusual or highly variable in volume shall be subject to flow equalization or other forms of 
regulation.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Any water or waste which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the 
public sewer 
system, releases obnoxious gases or develops color of undesirable intensity, or forms suspended 
solids in objectionable concentration, or creates any other condition deleterious to structures and 
treatment processes, shall be subject to control of the director.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The admission into the public sewers of any water 
or waste (1) having a five-day 
biochemical oxygen demand greater than two hundred (200) mg/l; or (2) containing more than 
two hundred forty (240) mg/l of total suspended solids; or (3) having a COD greater than four 
hundred (400) mg/l; or (4) having an average daily flow or a maximum peak flow greater than 
allotted percentages of the total average wastewater flow or maximum peak flow in a sewer or to 
a treatment facility as allocated by the director; or (5) containing any quantity of substances 
having the characteristics described in Section 22-215 or Section 22-215.05, shall be subject to 
the review and approval of the director. Where necessary in the opinion of the director, the 
owner shall provide at his expense such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to (1) reduce 
the biochemical oxygen demand to less than two hundred (200) mg/l, the total suspended solids 
to less than two hundred forty (240) mg/l and the COD to less than four hundred (400) mg/l; or 
(2) control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes; or (3) reduce 
objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in 
Section 22-215 or Section 22-215.05, or meet applicable state or federal pretreatment standards. 
Plans, specifications, compliance schedules and any other pertinent information relating to 
proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the director, and 
no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until such approval is obtained in writing.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Any decision of the director concerning this section and/or pretreatment 
standards may be 
appealed to the city council by filing a statement with the city clerk within ten (10) days after the 
director's decision. Such statement shall include:</span></font></div>
