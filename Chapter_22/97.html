<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All or part of the costs of public improvements may be assessed 
against lands benefitted and 
chargeable therewith. The charges made shall be known as special assessments for 
improvements. The charges shall be made by levying special assessments and issuing tax bills 
against the property benefitted by the improvement, and chargeable with the cost of such 
improvement. Upon the completion of any improvement, the city official charged with the 
responsibility for such improvement shall compute the cost thereof, make a written report to the 
council that the improvement has been completed and apportion all or part of the cost of such 
improvement among the lots, parcels and tracts of land benefitted thereby and chargeable 
therewith, charging each tract of land with its proportionate part of such costs. The council shall, 
by ordinance, after a public hearing levy special assessments and authorize the issuance of tax 
bills against the lots, parcels and tracts of land benefitted by the improvement and chargeable 
with the costs thereof. The ordinance shall contain a description of each lot, tract or parcel of 
land chargeable with a part of the cost of the improvement and the amount with which it is 
chargeable. The city clerk shall issue the tax bills and deliver them to the director of finance for 
collection. Tax bills shall be signed by the clerk and sealed with the corporate seal of the city. 
Public improvements made by city departments and employees may be paid for in the same 
manner as herein provided for any improvement made by contract. When an ordinance levying a 
special assessment is passed, a copy of the tax bill authorized thereby, shall be delivered to the 
then record owner of the property charged therewith. The special assessment and tax bill shall be 
a first lien upon the property. The lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law.</div>
