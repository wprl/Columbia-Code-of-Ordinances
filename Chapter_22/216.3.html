<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a condition of issuing a discharge permit, the 
director may require any permit

<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a condition of issuing a discharge permit, the 
director or his designees shall have the 
right to enter the premises of the facility generating the wastewater to inspect the facility, sample 
the wastewater and inspect and copy any records required to be kept relating to the wastewater or 
to enter any other premises where records are kept relating to the wastewater to inspect those 
records.</span></font></div>

<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director is authorized after investigation to 
grant or deny the permit, or after the 
permit is issued to revoke the permit, upon discovery of a violation of the permit restrictions or to 
reconsider the permit if changes in local, state or federal pretreatment standards so require.</span></font></div>

expiration date of the permit if the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by the 
permit after the expiration date of the permit.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) &nbsp;An expired permit will continue to be effective and
