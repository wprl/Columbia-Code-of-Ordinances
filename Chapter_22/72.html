advertisement shall advise bidders that the city reserves the rights to reject any and all bids. &nbsp;All 
bids shall be accompanied by a certified check or bid bond with corporate surety, satisfactory to

a public improvement project costing more than twenty-five 
thousand dollars ($25,000.00) shall give to the city performance and payment bonds, with
