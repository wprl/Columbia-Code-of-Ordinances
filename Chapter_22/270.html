<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The city will perform analyses at intervals no greater than twelve (12) months to determine 
the strength of sewage discharged by </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
any </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
users who discharge an annual average volume of 
twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons or more of sewage per average work day and whose 
wastes are subject to extra strength charges. </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
Any </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
users who discharge an average of less than 
twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day and whose wastes are subject to extra strength 
charges shall have their wastes analyzed as often as deemed necessary by the director to obtain 
representative samples. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
If any user chooses not to accept the analytical determination made by the city, they may, 
at their sole expense, employ an independent laboratory, acceptable to the director, to conduct 
sampling and analysis of their sewage. The time period and location for the collection of the 
samples shall be designated by the city. The city and the independent laboratory shall both 
preside over the collection of the samples and shall equally divide the final composite so that a 
duplicate analysis may be made. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If results of the analysis of the sewage sample 
by both the city and the independent 
laboratory are not comparable, the director may appoint a second independent laboratory to 
analyze the sewage. The sampling procedures used will be the same as those outlined above. The 
results of these analyses, together with the previous results, shall be used to determine the actual 
extra strength charges. The fee for the second independent laboratory analysis, shall be shared 
equally between the city and the user.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
If any user improves the quality of their discharged sewage, the city will reevaluate the 
strength of the sewage if requested to do so by the user. The user will pay an additional 
monitoring charge for the necessary sampling and analysis. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
The director or </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
the director&#146;s </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
authorized representatives shall have the right to enter upon 
all premises served by the wastewater system of the city, for the purpose of inspecting, reading or 
otherwise examining all meters and appurtenances involved in the recording of water received on 
the premises or sewage discharged therefrom, or to collect samples for analysis of sewage 
discharged therefrom. </span></font></div>
