<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly make 
a false complaint against the owner 
of any structure or relating to any structure subject to the inspection provisions of this article.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A false complaint shall be presumed to be knowingly made 
where such complaint is the 
third or more complaint made with respect to any structure or any owner by such person, in any 
twelve-month period, where inspections pursuant to such complaints fail to reveal any violation 
of the provisions of city ordinance upon inspection by housing inspectors of the city. This 
presumption shall be rebuttable.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Any person violating the provisions of this section shall 
be deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be fined an amount of not less than twenty 
dollars ($20.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), or by imprisonment in the city jail 
for not exceeding three (3) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each false complaint 
shall constitute a separate offense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) In addition to the criminal remedies herein provided 
for, the city counselor is hereby 
authorized to pursue any person who knowingly makes a false complaint, who shall be liable for 
the city's actual costs of inspection resulting from such complaint.</div>
