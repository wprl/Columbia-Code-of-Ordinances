<p class=texthead>Section 22-229 Sewer extension; reimbursement of property owners from project connection fees.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city council may, by ordinance, 
authorize agreements allowing property owners to 
extend city sewers to serve their property in situations where the city would normally extend the 
sewers but lacks the funding to do so. &nbsp;Such agreements must provide that the sewer will be built 
in accordance with city plans and specifications. &nbsp;The city may agree to partially reimburse the 
person or persons extending a sewer from project connection fees charged to other property 
owners in the project drainage area.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reimbursement shall be computed 
by subtracting the total pro rata contribution of all 
persons paying or agreeing to pay for the sewer, before construction began, from the total cost of 
the project. &nbsp;The total cost of the project shall be determined by the city based on documentation 
provided by the person constructing the project. &nbsp;The total area within the drainage basin served 
by the project will be calculated in square feet and identified as the project recovery area. &nbsp;The 
pro rata contribution shall be computed by multiplying the cost per square foot of the project 
times the number of square feet owned by the persons who have paid or agreed to pay at least 
their proportionate share of the project cost.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city may agree to reimburse the 
person constructing the sanitary sewer when the city 
is paid a project connection fee, separate from and in addition to any other fees normally 
collected by the city, by a person in the project recovery area who has not paid a connection fee 
before construction of the sanitary sewer began. &nbsp;Whenever a project connection fee is paid to 
the city, the city shall pay the person constructing the sewer a sum of money equivalent to the 
project connection fee, plus whatever penalties are charged by the city, less the cost of collection 
as determined by the director of finance. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed, 
however, to create any liability on behalf of the city; nor shall the city contract with the person 
building the sewer to create any liability for its failure to collect such connection fees.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreements made under this section 
shall be for a period not to exceed twenty (20) years. 
&nbsp;If the person constructing the sewer is no longer in existence or cannot be located by the city, 
the 
city shall cause the reimbursement to be made available to those persons who have contributed 
their proportionate share of the cost of the sewers before construction began, provided such 
persons must file claims and prove their claims to the director of public works within twenty (20) 
years from the date of the contract. &nbsp;If no such claims are filed, or if the city cannot locate 
the 
person constructing the sewers within twenty (20) years after the date of the contract, all such 
refunds shall forever be barred, and such money shall revert to the city&#146;s sewer fund.</div>
