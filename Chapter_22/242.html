<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of constructing joint district sewers, except the 
sum, if any, specified in the ordinance 
to be paid by the city, shall be assessed and paid in special tax bills against the property included 
in the joint sewer district, the same as is provided in the case of district sewers. The action of the 
council creating the joint sewer district shall be conclusive as to the necessity therefor, and no 
special tax bills shall be held invalid or be affected on account of the included drainage area 
thereof, or the size, character or purpose of such sewer; provided, it shall not include any district 
not contained in its natural drainage area or watercourse.</div>
