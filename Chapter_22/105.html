<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The city will maintain and repair, without charge to 
abutting property, all streets that are 
designated to be permanently improved streets by the council upon recommendation of the 
director of public works. All streets hereinafter constructed or reconstructed shall be constructed 
or reconstructed in accordance with the street construction standards and specifications set forth 
in the transportation plan and subdivision regulations.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The city will maintain unimproved streets only to the 
extent of keeping such streets in a 
safe and passable condition. Unimproved streets shall be those which have been heretofore 
constructed or improved but are not designated by the council as having been permanently 
improved. No dust control measures will be initiated by the city for unimproved streets. 
Residents or owners of property abutting unimproved streets may provide, at their expense, such 
dust control measures as may be approved by the director of public works.</div>
