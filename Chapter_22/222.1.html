&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited, to, accidental 
discharges, 
discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that 
may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the 
director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of 
waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived 
by the director, 
submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be 
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the 
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage 
to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such 
notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed 
pursuant to this ordinance.</span></font></div>

<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other 
prominent place 
advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a) above. 
Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised 
of the emergency notification procedure.</span></font></div>
