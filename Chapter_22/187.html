the owner, operator or tenant of a dwelling 
has been convicted of a violation of chapter 29 of this Code, or the director has revoked the 
certificate of compliance for the dwelling, the owner of the dwelling may apply to the director 
for a provisional certificate of compliance. &nbsp;In addition to the requirements contained in section 
22-186 of this article, the owner must also provide the director with information on the owner&#146;s 
compliance efforts or procedural changes which will ensure compliance with city codes. &nbsp;A 
provisional certificate of compliance shall expire one (1) year from the date of issuance. &nbsp;The 
director shall only issue a provisional certificate of compliance when the owner satisfies the 
director that the structure and the use of the structure is in compliance with city code. &nbsp;The 
director shall impose conditions upon which the provisional certificate of compliance is granted. 
At a minimum, these conditions shall include the following requirements:</span></font></div>

of compliance if the code inspector 
finds a violation of city codes.</span></font></div>

If there are no violations of chapter 29 of this Code, the owner may apply to the director for an 
extension of the provisional certificate of compliance for an additional one (1) year term. The 
director may grant no more than two (2) extensions of the provisional certificate of compliance.</span></font></div>
