<p class=texthead>Section 22-269 Determination of amount of use.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The amount of sewage discharged to the wastewater system 
of the city shall be determined 
by the quantity of water metered to the user; provided, however, that if actual sewer service 
cannot reasonably be determined from the water or sewage so metered, whether due to defect, 
tampering or causes unknown, the amount of sewage, waste or waters discharged into such 
system shall be estimated and billed as provided for in section 22-263 of this Code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Each person from whose property or premises sewage in 
any quantity is discharged into the 
wastewater system of the city, but who is not a water customer of such city, is hereby required to 
meter, at its source, the quantity of water used, with an appropriate meter to be approved by such 
city, and to pay a monthly sewer service charge based upon the amount of water thus metered, to 
be computed in like manner as provided in section 22-263 of this Code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Each user of the wastewater system of the city who is 
a water customer of such city, but 
who also obtains water from any source other than from such city, is hereby required to meter, at 
such other source, the quantity of water used, with an appropriate meter to be approved by said 
city, and to pay a monthly sewage service charge, based upon the amount of water thus metered, 
to be computed in like manner as is provided in section 22-263 of this Code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
If </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
any </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install a sewage meter acceptable 
to the director to measure the volume of liquid actually 
discharged into the wastewater system from his premises. Such meter shall be maintained and 
calibrated by the customer and the readings from the meter shall be taken at least twice weekly 
and shall be provided to the city on a monthly basis. In the event a sewage meter is installed the 
rate schedule as set forth in section 22-263 of this Code shall be applied to:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume 
of sewage entering the sanitary sewer as measured by the meter each 
month; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A calculated 
volume based on the percentage of metered water usage discharged to the 
wastewater system as determined by the historical comparison of water usage and metered 
sewage.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu of a sewage meter, the 
user may install auxiliary water meter(s) to measure that 
portion of water usage which is diverted from entering the wastewater system. In the event an 
auxiliary water meter is installed, the volume of water metered by such meter(s) shall be 
deducted from the total volume of water usage before the sewage service rate schedule is applied.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>No refunds, allowances or reductions from the one hundred (100) per cent water use 
base will be 
granted for any time period prior to approval of a wastewater metering or diverted water 
metering system.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, through no fault of the customer, a residential 
customer has been under-billed because 
of a malfunctioning water meter or inaccurate meter readings, the residential customer shall not 
be billed an additional amount for any sewer service received more than six (6) months before 
the current billing cycle.</span></font></div>
