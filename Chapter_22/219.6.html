&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samples and measurements taken as required herein 
shall be representative of the 
volume and nature of the monitored discharge. All samples shall be taken at the monitoring 
point(s) specified in </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
the applicable </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
permit and, unless otherwise specified, before the effluent 
joins or is diluted by any other waste stream, body of water or substance. All equipment used for 
sampling and analysis must be routinely calibrated, inspected and maintained to ensure their 
accuracy. Monitoring points shall not be changed without notification to and the approval of the 
City of Columbia.</span></font></div>

<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;If flow measurement is required by this permit, the appropriate flow 
measurement devices 
and methods consistent with approved scientific practices shall be selected and used to ensure the 
accuracy and reliability of measurements of the volume of monitored discharges. &nbsp;The devices 
shall be installed, calibrated, and maintained to ensure that the accuracy of the measurements are 
consistent with the accepted capability of that type of device. &nbsp;Devices selected shall be capable 
of measuring flows with a maximum deviation of less than 10 percent from true discharge rates 
throughout the range of expected discharge volumes.</span></font></div>
