&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tax bill shall contain a brief general statement of the facts authorizing 
its issue, the 
amount for which it is issued, the name of the record owner and the description of the property 
against which it is issued, the rate of interest which it bears, when it begins to bear interest, and 
shall state that it is a lien against the land therein described, and give the time that the lien 
continues. Tax bills shall bear no interest for sixty (60) days after the date of issue, at which time 
such tax bills shall be due and payable in full. After the expiration of sixty (60) days, tax bills 
shall bear interest, on the unpaid balance, at a rate </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
equal to the <i>Wall Street Journal&#146;s</i> Prime Rate 
as published on the day the city council adopts the resolution declaring the necessity of the 
project or as published two weeks before the first reading of the ordinance authorizing issuance 
of the tax bills, whichever rate is lower. &nbsp;Tax bills issued after January 1, 2006, for projects 
for 
which the city council has adopted a resolution of necessity before January 1, 2006, shall bear 
interest, on the unpaid balance, at a rate of nine (9) percent or at a rate equal to the <i>Wall Street 
Journal&#146;s</i> Prime Rate as published two weeks before the first reading of the ordinance 
authorizing issuance of the tax bills, whichever rate is lower. &nbsp;The interest rate</span><font 
color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;shall be set forth 
in the ordinance authorizing issuance </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
of the tax bills</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
. Every tax bill shall be a lien against the lot, 
tract or parcel of land described therein for a period of ten (10) years after date of issue, unless 
sooner paid. The lien, for tax bills payable in installments, shall expire one year after the date of 
maturity of the last installment, except when it becomes necessary to bring suit to enforce the 
lien, in which case the lien shall continue until the expiration of the litigation. All tax bills shall 
be assignable, and the owner or holder of any tax bill may enforce the collection thereof by filing 
suit in a court of competent jurisdiction, in the name of the city to his own use or in an action 
brought by the city in its own name and for its own use. If the property owner cannot be served 
by legal process, a suit may be brought by attachment or by any other legal remedy. Tax bills 
shall be prima facie evidence of what they contain, of their own validity, of the facts authorizing 
their issue, that they are a lien on the land described and, in all tax bills issued in payment for 
sewers, the liability of the person named as the owner of such property. No mere informality or 
clerical mistake in any of the proceedings shall be a defense thereto. Any error made in issuing 
any tax bill may be corrected by the city clerk, either by interlineation or by issuing a new tax bill 
in lieu of the erroneous one. When a tax bill is corrected by interlineation, the date of making 
same shall be certified by the clerk on the margin or back of the bill. In any action brought on 
any tax bill, the court shall have the authority to correct any error in the tax bill. </span></font></div>
