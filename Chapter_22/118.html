<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To the extent that staff and resources are available 
to properly support and monitor 
volunteer cleanup efforts, the public works department shall establish and coordinate volunteer 
efforts to clean up streets, right of ways, city property, or property used for city purposes. Such 
programs or efforts shall not be intended to replace normal maintenance responsibilities of the 
city, but rather to provide additional resources in areas of public use and visibility.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The public works department shall determine the suitability 
of any street right of way, 
public area or property used for city purposes to be adopted, taking into consideration the 
character of the area, traffic volumes, general safety concerns and long-term maintenance 
responsibilities. If areas proposed to be adopted are not on properties controlled by the 
department of public works, the department shall serve as a coordinator with the appropriate city 
department and no work shall be performed until approval is received by the department of 
public works from the proper city department. In exercising discretion, the director may consider 
the following:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Arterial and commercial collector streets.</i> Arterial and those collector streets that serve a 
predominantly commercial area or along which the abutting property is unplatted and 
undeveloped may be adopted by adjacent property owners, individuals, or organizations and 
clubs. First preference shall be given to adjacent property owners. Adoption of these streets shall 
not be allowed for groups with participating children under twelve years of age.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Residential collector and local residential streets.</i> Neighborhood residential and 
collector streets that are obviously residential in character may be adopted only by adjacent 
property owners in either the form of a recognized homeowners association, church congregation 
or church or school sponsored social or scout groups, or by petition of more than one-half of the 
abutting property owners.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Public areas.</i> Property that is owned or controlled by the city, or where city operations 
are conducted, may be adopted. Areas in this category include recycling drop-off points, yard 
waste drop-off sites, linear parks and railroad right of ways.</span></div>
