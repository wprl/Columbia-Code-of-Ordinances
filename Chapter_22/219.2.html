<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the 
effective date of a categorical 
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 
CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or 
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the director a report which contains the 
information listed in paragraph (b) below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of 
their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the 
promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director a report which 
contains the information listed in paragraph (b) below. A new source shall report the method of 
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall 
give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Users described above shall submit the information set 
forth below.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Identifying information.</i> The name and address of the facility, including the name of the 
operator and owner.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Environmental permits.</i> A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the 
facility.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Description of operations.</i> A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, 
and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This 
description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to 
the POTW from the regulated processes.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Flow measurement.</i> Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily 
flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as 
necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Measurement of pollutants.</i></span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The categorical 
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results 
of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or 
mass, where required by the standard or by the director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge 
from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average 
concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of 
daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 22.219.3 
of this ordinance.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sampling 
must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 22.219.3 
of this ordinance.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Certification.</i> A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified 
by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a 
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) and/or 
additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Compliance schedule.</i> If additional pretreatment and/or O&amp;M will be required to meet 
the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional 
pretreatment and/or O&amp;M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the 
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule 
pursuant to this section must meet the following requirements:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule 
shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the 
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of 
additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such 
events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, 
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and 
beginning and conducting routine operation);</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No increment 
referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user 
shall submit a progress report to the director no later than fourteen (14) days 
following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, 
whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if 
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no event 
shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the 
director.</div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Signature and certification.</i> All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified 
in accordance with section 22-220 of this ordinance.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard 
deadline. Within ninety (90) 
days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, 
or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into 
the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the 
director a report containing the information described in section 22-219.2(b)(4-6) of this 
ordinance. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance 
with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the 
user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to a categorical pretreatment 
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other 
measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate 
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 
22-220 of this ordinance.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Periodic compliance reports.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All significant industrial users 
shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no 
case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and 
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the 
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic 
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 22-220 of this 
ordinance.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All wastewater samples must be 
representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater 
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and 
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility 
in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are 
unrepresentative of its discharge.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a user subject to the reporting 
requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more 
frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in section 22-2.19.3 of 
this ordinance, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.</div>
