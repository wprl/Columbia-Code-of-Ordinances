<p class=texthead>Section 3-7 License or permit revocation.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The director may revoke or suspend any license or permit 
granted pursuant to the 
provisions of this chapter whenever he shall find, after a hearing, that the licensee or permittee 
has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to section 3-6 
or when any licensee or permittee shall have been convicted in municipal court of violating any 
city ordinance. In such case all license or permit fees paid by said licensee shall be forfeited.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The licensee or permittee may appeal any revocation or 
suspension to the city council. 
Such appeal shall delay the revocation or suspension until the city council conducts a hearing and 
either upholds, overrules, modifies, or amends the director's action.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The manager may immediately suspend any license, contract, 
permit, enterprise, or conduct 
whenever an emergency exists or the continuance of said license, contract, permit, enterprise or 
conduct poses an immediate threat to the health, safety, or welfare of others. The director may 
continue the suspension, regardless of an appeal, if an emergency or threat to safety continues in 
existence.</div>
