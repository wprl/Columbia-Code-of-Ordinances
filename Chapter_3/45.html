<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event any taxi or limousine is found to be in violation 
of this chapter, the manager may 
immediately suspend its permit by removing the same from the vehicle. Suspensions shall be for 
a period of from five (5) to thirty (30) calendar days depending upon the severity of the offense. 
Suspensions may be appealed by the filing of a written request for a hearing with the director 
within ten (10) calendar days of the date of suspension. The filing of a written appeal by the 
permittee shall serve to delay the imposition of the suspension until a final decision by the 
director. The director's decision may be appealed to the council in the same manner as provided 
in section 3-7(b).</div>
