<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The use of physical force by an actor upon another person 
is justifiable when the actor is a

incompetent person or when the actor is a teacher or other person entrusted with the care and 
supervision of a minor for a special purpose; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actor reasonably believes 
that the force used is necessary to promote the welfare of a 
minor or incompetent person, or, if the actor's responsibility for the minor is for special purposes, 
to further that special purpose or to maintain reasonable discipline in a school, class or other 
group; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force used is not designed 
to cause or believed to create a substantial risk of causing 
death, serious physical injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or extreme emotional distress.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The use of physical force by an actor upon another person 
is justifiable when the actor is a 
person responsible for the operation of or the maintenance of order in a vehicle or other carrier of

with its operation or to maintain order in the vehicle or other carrier, except that deadly force 
may not be used unless the use of deadly force is authorized by state and federal law.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The use of physical force by an actor upon another person

<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force is used for the purpose

actor reasonably believes that no one competent to consent can be consulted and that a 
reasonable person, wishing to safeguard the welfare of the patient, would consent.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The use of physical force by an actor upon another person
