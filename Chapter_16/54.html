<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Except in infraction cases, when probation is granted, 
the court, in addition to conditions 
imposed under section 16-53, may require as a condition of probation that the defendant submit 
to a period of detention in an appropriate institution at whatever time or intervals within the 
period of probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive, the court shall designate.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In misdemeanor cases, the period of detention under this 
section shall not exceed the 
shorter of fifteen (15) days or the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the 
misdemeanor by division 3 of this article.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If probation is revoked and a term of imprisonment is 
served by reason thereof, the time 
spent in jail or other institution as a detention condition of probation shall be credited against the 
prison or jail term served for the offense in connection with which the detention condition was 
imposed.</div>
