<p class=texthead>Section 16-122 Conspiracy.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person 
or persons to commit an offense if, 
with the purposes of promoting or facilitating its commission he agrees with such other person or 
persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such offense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If a person guilty of conspiracy knows that a person 
with whom he conspires to commit an 
offense has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same offense, he is guilty of 
conspiring with such other person or persons to commit such offense, whether or not he knows 
their identity.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If a person conspires to commit a number of offenses, 
he is guilty of only one conspiracy 
so long as such multiple offenses are the object of the same agreement.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit an 
offense unless an overt act in 
pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with 
whom he conspired.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l) No one shall be convicted 
of conspiracy if, after conspiring to commit the offense, he 
prevented the accomplishment of the objectives of the conspiracy under circumstances 
manifesting a renunciation of his criminal purpose.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant shall have the burden 
of injecting the issue of renunciation of criminal 
purpose under subparagraph (e)(1) of this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) For the purpose of time limitations on prosecutions:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conspiracy is a continuing course 
of conduct which terminates when the offense or 
offenses which are its object are committed or the agreement that they be committed is 
abandoned by the defendant and by those with whom he conspired.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an individual abandons the 
agreement, the conspiracy is terminated as to him only if he 
advises those with whom he has conspired of his abandonment or he informs the law 
enforcement authorities of the existence of the conspiracy and of his participation in it.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) A person may not be charged, convicted or sentenced on 
the basis of the same course of 
conduct of both the actual commission of an offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Unless otherwise provided, a conspiracy to commit an 
offense is a class C misdemeanor if 
the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor of any degree or an infraction.</div>
