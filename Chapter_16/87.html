<p class=texthead>Section 16-87 Responsibility for the conduct of another.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person is criminally responsible for the conduct of 
another when:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinance defining the offense 
makes him so responsible; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either before or during the commission 
of an offense with the purpose of promoting the 
commission of an offense, he aids or agrees to aid or attempts to aid such other person in 
planning, committing or attempting to commit the offense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) However, a person is not so responsible if:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the victim of the offense 
committed or attempted;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offense is so defined that 
his conduct was necessarily incident to the commission or 
attempt to commit the offense. If his conduct constitutes a related but separate offense, he is 
criminally responsible for that offense but not for the conduct or offense committed or attempted 
by the other person;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the commission of the offense 
he abandons his purpose and gives timely warning 
to law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the 
offense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The defense provided by subparagraph (b)(3) of this section 
is an affirmative defense.</div>
<br>
