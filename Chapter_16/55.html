<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurisdiction over a probationer may be transferred from the 
court which imposed probation to 
a court having equal jurisdiction over offenders in any other part of the state, if any, with the 
concurrence of both courts. Retransfers of jurisdiction may also occur in the same manner. The 
court to which jurisdiction has been transferred under this section shall be authorized to exercise 
all power permissible under this chapter over the defendant, except that the term of probation 
shall not be terminated without the consent of the sentencing court.</div>
