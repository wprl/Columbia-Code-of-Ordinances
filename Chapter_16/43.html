<p class=texthead>Section 16-43 Calculation of terms of imprisonment; credit for jail time awaiting trial.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person convicted of a crime in this city shall receive 
as credit toward service of a 
sentence of imprisonment all time spent by him in jail because of awaiting trial for such crime. 
Time required by law to be credited upon some other sentence shall be applied to that sentence 
alone, except that:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent in jail awaiting trial 
for an offense because of a detainer for such offense 
shall be credited toward service of a sentence of imprisonment for that offense even though the 
person was confined awaiting trial for some unrelated bailable offense; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for jail time shall be 
applied to each sentence if they are concurrent.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The officer required by law to deliver a convicted person 
to jail shall endorse upon the 
commitment papers the period of time to be credited as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If a sentence of imprisonment is vacated and a new sentence 
is imposed on the defendant 
for the same offense, the new sentence is calculated as if it had commenced at the time the 
vacated sentence was imposed, and all time served under the vacated sentence shall be credited 
against the new sentence.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) If a person serving a sentence of imprisonment escapes 
from custody, the escape interrupts 
the sentence. The interruption continues until the person is returned to the institution in which 
the sentence was being served.</div>
