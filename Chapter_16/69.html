<p class=texthead>Section 16-69 Response to nonpayment.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) When an offender sentenced to pay a fine defaults in 
the payment of the fine or in any 
installment, the court upon motion of the city counselor or upon its own motion may require him 
to show cause why he should not be imprisoned for nonpayment. The court may issue a warrant 
of arrest or a summons for his appearance.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Following an order to show cause under paragraph (a) 
of this section, unless the offender 
shows that his default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the sentence of the 
court, or not attributable to a failure on his part to make a good faith effort to obtain the 
necessary funds for payment, the court may order the defendant imprisoned for a term not to 
exceed thirty (30) days if the fine was imposed for conviction of a misdemeanor or infraction. 
The court may provide in its order that payment or satisfaction of the fine at any time will entitle 
the offender to his release from such imprisonment or, after entering the order, may at any time 
reduce the sentence for good cause shown, including payment or satisfaction of the fine.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine 
is excusable under the standards set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the court may enter an order allowing the offender 
additional time for payment, reducing the amount of the fine or of each installment, or revoking 
the fine or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) When a fine is imposed on a corporation it is the duty 
of the person or persons authorized 
to make disbursement of the assets of the corporation and their superiors to pay the fine from the 
assets of the corporation. The failure of such persons to do so shall render them subject to 
imprisonment under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Upon default in the payment of a fine or any installment 
thereof, the fine may be collected 
by any means authorized for the enforcement of money judgments.</div>
