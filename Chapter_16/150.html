<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following words and phrases, as used in sections 16-151

<i>Enter unlawfully or remain unlawfully.</i> A person &quot;enters unlawfully or remains unlawfully&quot; 
in 
or upon premises when he is not licensed or privileged to do so. A person who, regardless of his 
purpose, enters or remains in or upon premises which are at the time open to the public does so 
with license and privilege unless he defies a lawful order not to enter or remain, personally 
communicated to him by the owner of such premises or by other authorized person. A license or 
privilege to enter or remain in a building which is only partly open to the public is not a license 
or privilege to enter or remain in that part of the building which is not open to the public.</span></div>

proprietary interest therein, except that, for purposes of sections 16-161 through 16-163, property 
shall not be deemed property of another who has only a security interest therein, even if legal 
title is in the creditor pursuant to a conditional sales contract or other security arrangement.</span></div>
