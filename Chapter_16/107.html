<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Unless inconsistent with the provisions of this division 
defining the justifiable use of 
physical force, or with some other provision of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute an 
offense is justifiable and not criminal when such conduct is required or authorized by a statutory 
provision or by a judicial decree. Among the kinds of such provisions and decrees are:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws defining duties and functions 
of public servants;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws defining duties of private 
persons to assist public servants in the performance of 
their functions;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws governing the execution of 
legal process;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws governing the military services 
and the conduct of war;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgments and orders of courts.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The defense of justification afforded by paragraph (a) 
of this section applies:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person reasonably believes 
his conduct to be required or authorized by the 
judgment or directions of a competent court or tribunal or in the legal execution of legal process, 
notwithstanding lack of jurisdiction of the court or defect in the legal process;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person reasonably believes 
his conduct to be required or authorized to assist a 
public servant in the performance of his duties, notwithstanding that the public servant exceeded 
his legal authority.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the 
issue of justification under this 
section.</div>
