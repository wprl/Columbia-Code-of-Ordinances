<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person may, subject to the limitations of paragraph

stealing, property damage or tampering in any degree.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A person may not use deadly force under circumstances 
described in paragraph (a) of this

<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The justification afforded by this section extends to
