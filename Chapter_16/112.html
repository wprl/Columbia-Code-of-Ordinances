<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A law enforcement officer need not retreat or desist 
from efforts to effect the arrest, or 
from efforts to prevent the escape from custody, of a person he reasonably believes to have 
committed an offense because of resistance or threatened resistance of the arrestee. In addition to 
the use of physical force authorized under other sections of this chapter, he is, subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, justified in the use of such physical force as 
he reasonably believes is immediately necessary to effect the arrest or to prevent the escape from 
custody.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The use of any physical force in making an arrest is 
not justified under this section unless 
the arrest is lawful or the law enforcement officer reasonably believes the arrest is lawful.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A law enforcement officer in effecting an arrest or in 
preventing an escape from custody is 
not justified in using deadly force unless the use of deadly force is authorized under state or 
federal law.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the 
issue of justification under this 
section.</div>
