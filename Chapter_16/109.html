<p class=texthead>Section 16-109 Use of force in defense of persons.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person may, subject to the provisions of paragraph 
(b) of this section, use physical force 
upon another person when and to the extent he reasonably believes such to be necessary to 
defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use 
of unlawful force by such other person, unless:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actor was the initial aggressor; 
except that in such case his use of force is 
nevertheless justified provided:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has 
withdrawn from the encounter and effectively communicated such withdrawal to 
such other person but the latter persists in continuing the incident by the use or threatened use of 
unlawful force; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a 
law enforcement officer and as such is an aggressor pursuant to section 563.046, 
RSMo.; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggression 
is justified under some other provision of this division or other 
provision of law.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances as the 
actor reasonably believes them to be, the person whom he 
seeks to protect would not be justified in using such protective force.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A person may not use deadly force upon another person 
under the circumstances specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section unless deadly force is authorized under state or federal law.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The justification afforded by this section extends to 
the use of physical restraint as 
protective force provided that the actor takes all reasonable measures to terminate the restraint as 
soon as it is reasonable to do so.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the 
issue of justification under this 
section.</div>
