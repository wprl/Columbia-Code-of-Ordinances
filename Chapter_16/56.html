<p class=texthead>Section 16-56 Duration of probation; revocation.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A term of probation commences on the day it is imposed. 
Multiple terms of probation, 
whether imposed at the same time or at different times, shall run concurrently. Terms of 
probation shall also run concurrently with any federal or other state jail, prison, probation or 
parole term for another offense to which the defendant is or becomes subject during the period, 
unless otherwise specified by the court.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The court may terminate a period of probation and discharge 
the defendant at any time 
before completion of the specific term fixed under section 16-52 if warranted by the conduct of 
the defendant and the ends of justice. Procedures for termination and discharge may be 
established by rule of court.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If the defendant violates a condition of probation at 
any time prior to the expiration or 
termination of the probation term, the court may continue him on the existing conditions, with or 
without modifying or enlarging the conditions, or, if such continuation, modification, or 
enlargement is not appropriate, may revoke probation and order that any sentence previously 
imposed be executed. If imposition of sentence was suspended, the court may revoke probation 
and impose any sentence available under section 16-83. The court may mitigate any sentence of 
imprisonment by reducing the prison or jail term by all or part of the time the defendant was on 
probation.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Probation shall not be revoked without giving the probationer 
notice and an opportunity to 
be heard on the issues of whether he violated a condition of probation and, if he did, whether 
revocation is warranted under all the circumstances.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) At any time during the term of probation the court may 
issue a notice to the probationer to 
appear to answer a charge of a violation, and the court may issue a warrant of arrest for the 
violation. Such notice shall be personally served upon the probationer. The warrant shall 
authorize the return of the probationer to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention 
facility designated by the court.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Any probation officer, if he has probable cause to believe 
that the probationer has violated 
a condition of probation, may arrest the probationer without a warrant, or may deputize any other 
officer with the power of arrest to do so by giving him a written statement of the circumstances 
of the alleged violation, including a statement that the probationer has, in the judgment of the 
probation officer, violated the conditions of his probation. The written statement, delivered with 
the probationer to the official in charge of any jail or other detention facility, shall be sufficient 
authority for detaining the probationer pending a preliminary hearing on the alleged violation.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) If the probationer is arrested under the authority granted 
in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section, he shall have the right to a preliminary hearing on the violation charged. He shall be 
notified immediately in writing of the alleged probation violation. If he is arrested in the 
jurisdiction of the sentencing court, and the court which placed him on probation is immediately 
available, the preliminary hearing shall be heard by the sentencing court. Such preliminary 
hearings shall be conducted as provided by rule of court. If it appears that there is probable cause 
to believe that the probationer has violated a condition of his probation, or if the probationer 
waives the preliminary hearing, the judge shall order the probationer held for further proceedings 
in the sentencing court. If probable cause is not found, this shall not bar the sentencing court 
from holding a hearing on the question of the probationer's alleged violation of a condition of 
probation nor from ordering the probationer to be present at such a hearing. Provisions regarding 
release on bail of persons charged with offenses shall be applicable to probationers arrested and 
ordered held under this provision.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Upon such arrest and detention, the probation officer 
shall immediately notify the 
sentencing court and shall submit to the court a written report showing in what manner the 
probationer has violated the conditions of probation. Thereupon, or upon arrest by warrant, the 
court shall cause the probationer to be brought before it without unnecessary delay for a hearing 
on the violation charged. Revocation hearings shall be conducted as provided by rule of court.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The power of the court to revoke probation shall extend 
for the duration of the term of 
probation designated by the court and for any further period which is reasonably necessary for 
the adjudication of matters arising before its expiration, provided that some affirmative 
manifestation of an intent to conduct a revocation hearing occurs prior to the expiration of the 
period and that every reasonable effort is made to notify the probationer and to conduct the 
hearing prior to the expiration of the period.</div>
