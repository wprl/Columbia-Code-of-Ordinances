The purpose of this section is to ensure that patients, for whom marijuana has been 
recommended by a physician, suffer no punishment or penalty for obtaining, possessing, and/or 
using medicinal marijuana and/or paraphernalia used to consume medicinal marijuana.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
Seriously ill adults who obtain and use marijuana and/or marijuana paraphernalia for 
medicinal purposes pursuant to the recommendation of a physician shall not be subject to arrest, 
prosecution, punishment or sanction. &nbsp;Physicians who recommend marijuana for their patients 
shall not be subject to &nbsp;arrest, prosecution, punishment or sanction. &nbsp;If an adult obtains 
a 
physician&#146;s recommendation for marijuana use after an arrest, such charges shall be dismissed. 
If 
this provision is held invalid, then a maximum fine of fifty (50) dollars may be imposed. There 
shall be a strong presumption that the appropriate disposition is to defer prosecution or to 
suspend imposition of sentence. &nbsp;All such matters shall only be referred to the Municipal 
Prosecuting Attorney, and no other prosecuting attorney, and the Municipal Prosecuting Attorney 
shall not refer the matter to any other prosecutor, agency, or office, unless the adult is also 
charged with a felony offense arising from the same set of facts and circumstances. &nbsp;The term 
&#147;seriously ill adults&#148; shall include patients who suffer from side-effects of the treatment 
of 
cancer, HIV/AIDS or symptoms of multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine headaches, 
chronic severe pain, or any other serious condition for which marijuana provides relief and for 
which a duly-licensed physician has recommended such use.</span></font></div>
