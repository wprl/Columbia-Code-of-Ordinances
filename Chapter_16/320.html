<p class=texthead>Section 16-320 Effect of property conveyance.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When title to property is conveyed, 
any nuisance activity that occurred before the 
conveyance may not be used to establish the property as a chronic nuisance property unless the 
reason for the conveyance was to avoid a determination that the property was a chronic nuisance 
property. &nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rebuttable presumption 
that a reason for the conveyance of property was to 
avoid a determination that the property was a chronic nuisance property if:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property was conveyed for 
less than fair market value;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property was conveyed to an 
entity controlled by a person conveying the property;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property was conveyed to a 
relative of a person conveying the property.</div>
