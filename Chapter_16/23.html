commission of the offense charged; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is specifically denominated 
by ordinance as a lesser degree of the offense charged; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It consists of an attempt to commit 
the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise
