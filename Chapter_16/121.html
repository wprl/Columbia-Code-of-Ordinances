<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person is guilty of attempt to commit an offense when, 
with the purpose of committing 
the offense, he does any act which is a substantial step towards the commission of the offense. A 
&quot;substantial step&quot; is conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's 
purpose to complete the commission of the offense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It is no defense to a prosecution under this section 
that the offense attempted was, under 
the actual attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such offense 
could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to 
be.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Unless otherwise provided, an attempt to commit an offense 
is a class C misdemeanor if 
the offense attempted is a misdemeanor of any degree.</div>
