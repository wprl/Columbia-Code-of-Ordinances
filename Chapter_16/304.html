<p class=texthead>Section 16-304 Nuisance parties -- residential rental properties; certificate of compliance sanctions.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Intent of section. &nbsp;</i>This section shall set forth administrative 
procedures and standards for 
revoking a residential landlord's certificate of compliance under the Rental Unit Conservation 
Law (Sec. 22-181, et seq. of this code) when multiple nuisance parties have occurred on 
residential rental property. &nbsp;The city seeks the cooperation of residential landlords in eliminating 
nuisance parties held by their tenants. &nbsp;The sanction of revoking a certificate of compliance is 
intended as a last resort after other attempts to eliminate the problem have failed. &nbsp;This section 
also establishes the offense of failure to prevent a nuisance party.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Initial nuisance party.</i> &nbsp;Within ten (10) days after the initial nuisance party that serves 
as a basis for a certificate of compliance sanction, the police department shall send the property 
owner and tenants of the unit hosting the gathering, by certified mail, a notice of nuisance party 
ordinance violation. &nbsp;The notice shall set forth the date, place and nature of the violation and 
urge 
the property owner and tenants to take action to prevent future nuisance parties on the property. 
&nbsp;If notice cannot be given to a party by certified mail, notice shall be given by first class mail 
and 
by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the dwelling.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Subsequent nuisance party; compliance meeting.</i> &nbsp;If a subsequent 
nuisance party occurs at 
the same unit within a twelve (12) month period, the police department shall send the property 
owner and tenants, by certified mail, another notice of nuisance party violation within ten (10) 
days of the party. &nbsp;If notice cannot be given to a party by certified mail, notice shall be given 
by 
first class mail and by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the dwelling. &nbsp;The 
notice shall set forth the date, place and nature of the violation and shall schedule a nuisance 
party ordinance compliance meeting. &nbsp;The compliance meeting shall be attended by a police 
department representative, by the property owner or the owner's agent and by the tenants 
responsible for the nuisance party. &nbsp;The purpose of the compliance meeting is to reach agreement 
on corrective action necessary to avoid future nuisance parties on the property. &nbsp;Possible 
corrective actions include, but are not limited to:</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agreement by tenants to impose limits on social gatherings such as restrictions 
on the 
number of guests, time, music, consumption of alcoholic beverages, etc.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agreement by the property owner not to renew the lease or to initiate 
an eviction action 
if further nuisance parties are held on the property.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
If agreement is reached, a police department representative shall reduce the corrective action to 
writing and shall provide a copy to the property owner and tenants.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owner&#146;s 
failure to prevent a third nuisance party. &nbsp;It shall be unlawful for the owner 
of any residential rental property to fail to prevent a nuisance party within twelve (12) months of 
a nuisance party that triggered a compliance meeting under subsection (c). &nbsp;An owner of 
residential rental property shall not be prosecuted for a violation of this subsection unless:</span></font></div>

with a violation of Sec. 16-302 or Sec. 16-303 or an 
offense that caused a social gathering to become a nuisance party in connection with a nuisance 
party at the residential unit which triggered a notice under Sec. 16-304 (b); and</span></font></div>

(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Revocation of certificate of compliance.</i> &nbsp;A

institute a contested case for that purpose in accordance with Chapter 536, RSMo. The property 
owner and affected tenants shall be necessary parties to the case. &nbsp;The city manager or the

corrective action satisfactory to the chief of police to avoid future nuisance parties.</span></font></div>
