<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person &quot;acts knowingly, &quot; or with knowledge:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to his conduct or 
to attendant circumstances when he is aware of the nature 
of his conduct or that those circumstances exist; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to a result of his

certain to cause that result.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A person &quot;acts purposely, &quot; or with purpose,

thereof when it is his conscious object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A person &quot;acts recklessly&quot; or is reckless when 
he consciously disregards a substantial and 
unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow and such disregard 
constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise 
in the situation.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) A person &quot;acts with criminal negligence&quot; or 
is criminally negligent when he fails to be 
aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will follow, and 
such failure constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person 
would exercise in the situation.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Except as provided in section 16-84, a person is not 
guilty of an offense unless he acts with 
a culpable mental state, that is, unless he acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly or with 
criminal negligence, as the statute defining the offense may require with respect to the conduct, 
the result thereof or the attendant circumstances which constitute the material elements of the 
crime.</div>
