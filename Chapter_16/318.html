&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before any property is determined to be a chronic 
nuisance property, the chief of police 
must notify the property owner in writing that at least two nuisance activities have occurred on</span></font><span 
style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;or 
within two hundred (200) feet of </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

chronic nuisance property. &nbsp;The notice shall identify the property and describe the alleged 
nuisance activities in detail including the dates on which the alleged nuisance activities occurred. 
The notice shall instruct the property owner to respond to the notice by either disputing the 
allegations of nuisance activities or proposing a plan to abate the nuisance activities. &nbsp;The notice 
shall be served on the property owner by first class and certified mail or by personal service in 
the same manner as legal process is served under any Missouri statute or court rule.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of police shall meet with any property 
owner who requests a meeting to dispute 
an allegation of nuisance activity or to discuss a plan to abate the nuisance activities. The 
property owner shall be notified of the position of the chief of police on all disputed allegations 
of nuisance activity within thirty (30) days after the meeting. &nbsp;</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after a property owner has received notice under 
subsection (a), the chief of police 
determines that an additional nuisance activity has occurred </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
on or within two hundred (200) feet 
of the property </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
causing the property to become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police 
shall give the property owner written notice of the determination. &nbsp;The notice shall identify the 
property and describe in detail the alleged nuisance activities that cause a property to be a 
chronic nuisance property. &nbsp;The notice shall be served on the property owner by first class and 
certified mail or by personal service in the same manner as legal process is served under any 
Missouri statute or court rule. &nbsp;A notice mailed by first class mail shall be presumed received 
three (3) days after it is mailed. &nbsp;The property owner shall have ten (10) days after receipt of 
the 
notice to arrange a meeting with the chief of police to dispute the determination of chronic 
nuisance property or persuade the chief of police to defer submitting the matter to the city 
manager for abatement or to the city prosecutor for prosecution.</span></font></div>

police, the chief still believes that the property is a chronic nuisance property, the chief may 
submit a report on the matter to the city manager for abatement under section 16-319 or to the 
city prosecutor for prosecution under section 16-321. &nbsp;The chief of police may defer referring 
a 
chronic nuisance property to the city manager or the prosecutor if the property owner has 
presented an abatement plan satisfactory to the chief of police and has made good faith efforts to 
implement the plan.</span></font></div>
