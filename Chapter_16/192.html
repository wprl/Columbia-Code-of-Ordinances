<p class=texthead>Section 16-192 False affidavit.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A person commits the crime of making a false affidavit 
if, with purpose to mislead any 
person, he, in any affidavit, swears falsely to a fact which is material to the purpose for which 
such affidavit is made.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the 
following shall apply:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fact is material, regardless 
of its admissibility under rules of evidence, if it could 
substantially affect, or did substantially affect, the course or outcome of the cause, matter or 
proceeding.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge of the materiality of 
the statement is not an element of this crime, and it is no 
defense that:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant 
mistakenly believed the fact to be immaterial; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defendant 
was not competent, for reasons other than mental disability or 
immaturity, to make the statement.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It is a defense to a prosecution under paragraph (a) 
of this section that the actor retracted 
the false statement by affidavit or testimony but this defense shall not apply if the retraction was 
made after:</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The falsity of the statement was 
exposed; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person took substantial action 
in reliance on the statement.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The defendant shall have the burden of injecting the 
issue of retraction under paragraph (b) 
of this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Making a false affidavit is a class A misdemeanor if 
done for the purpose of misleading a 
public servant in the performance of his duty; otherwise making a false affidavit is a class C 
misdemeanor.</div>
