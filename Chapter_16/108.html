<p class=texthead>Section 16-108 Justification generally.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Unless inconsistent with other provisions of this division 
defining justifiable use of 
physical force, or with some provision of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute any 
crime or murder is justifiable and not criminal when it is necessary as an emergency measure to 
avoid an imminent public or private injury which is about to occur by reason of a situation 
occasioned or developed through no fault of the actor, and which is of such gravity that, 
according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability of avoiding the 
injury outweighs the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the ordinance 
defining the crime charged.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The necessity and justifiability of conduct under paragraph 
(a) of this section may not rest 
upon considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the ordinance either in its 
general application or with respect to its application to a particular class of cases arising 
thereunder. Whenever evidence relating to the defense of justification under this section is 
offered, the court shall rule as a matter of law whether the claimed facts and circumstances 
would, if established, constitute a justification.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The defense of justification under this section is an 
affirmative defense.</div>
