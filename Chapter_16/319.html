<p class=texthead>Section 16-319 Administrative process for abating chronic nuisance property.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after reviewing the police 
chief&#146;s chronic nuisance property report, the city manager 
determines that the proper procedures have been followed and that there is reason to believe that 
the property may be a chronic nuisance property, the city manager may authorize the city 
counselor to initiate an administrative action to abate the nuisance. &nbsp;The administrative action 
shall follow the contested case provisions of Chapter 536, RSMo. &nbsp;The owners of the property 
and any tenants shall be necessary parties to the action. &nbsp;The city manager or the manager&#146;s 
designee shall serve as hearing officer.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after considering all evidence, 
the hearing officer determines that the property is a 
chronic nuisance property and that the procedures of section 16-318 were followed, the hearing 
officer may order appropriate abatement. &nbsp;Abatement may include closure of the property for up 
to one (1) year, physically securing the property, suspension of utility services during the period 
of closure and revocation of a certificate of compliance for rental property. &nbsp;If there is more 
than 
one (1) residential unit on the property, the hearing officer shall close only the unit or units 
whose occupants, guests or invitees have engaged in the nuisance activities. &nbsp;The hearing officer 
shall consider the following factors in determining whether to close a chronic nuisance property:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of cooperation of the 
property owner and occupants in attempting to prevent 
nuisance activities;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
nature and extent of the nuisance activities;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
impact of the nuisance activities on neighbors and others; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any actions taken to avoid further 
nuisance activities connected with the property.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an abatement order is not complied 
with, the hearing officer may authorize the 
abatement of the chronic nuisance property by city employees or by persons under contract with 
the city. &nbsp;No person shall enter private property to enforce an abatement order unless the person 
in possession of the property has consented to the entry or unless the municipal judge has issued 
a warrant for the entry. &nbsp;The chief of police shall certify the cost of abatement under this 
subsection to the city clerk. &nbsp;The cost shall include administrative costs as well as the actual 
cost 
of abating the nuisance. &nbsp;The city clerk shall cause a special tax bill against the property to 
be 
prepared in the amount of the abatement cost. &nbsp;The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall 
be a 
lien on the property until paid and shall be prima facie evidence of the recitals therein and of its 
validity. &nbsp;No clerical error or informality in the tax bill or in the proceedings leading up to 
the 
issuance of the tax bill shall be a defense in an action to collect the tax bill. &nbsp;Tax bills issued 
under this section, if not paid when due, shall bear interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per 
year. &nbsp;The cost of abatement shall also constitute a personal obligation of any person who failed 
to comply with the order of the hearing officer.</div>
