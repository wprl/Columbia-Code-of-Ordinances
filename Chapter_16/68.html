<p class=texthead>Section 16-68 Imposition of fines.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In determining the amount and the method of payment of 
a fine, the court shall, insofar as 
practicable, proportion the fine to the burden that payment will impose in view of the financial 
resources of an individual. The court shall not sentence an offender to pay a fine in any amount 
which will prevent him from making restitution or reparation to the victim of the offense.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) When any other disposition is authorized by statute, 
the court shall not sentence an 
individual to pay a fine only unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense 
and the history and character of the offender, it is of the opinion that the fine alone will suffice 
for the protection of the public.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The court shall not sentence an individual to pay a fine 
in addition to any other sentence 
authorized by section 16-31 unless:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has derived a pecuniary gain 
from the offense; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court is of the opinion that 
a fine is uniquely adapted to deterrence of the type of 
offense involved or to the correction of the defendant.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) When an offender is sentenced to pay a fine, the court 
may provide for the payment to be 
made within a specified period of time or in specified installments. If no such provision is made a 
part of the sentence, the fine shall be payable forthwith.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) When an offender is sentenced to pay a fine, the court 
shall not impose at the same time an 
alternative sentence to be served in the event that the fine is not paid. The response of the court 
to nonpayment shall be determined only after the fine has not been paid, as provided in section 
16-69.</div>
