<p class=texthead>Section 16-83 Same--Application.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) If the definition of an offense prescribes a culpable 
mental state but does not specify the 
conduct, attendant circumstances or result to which it applies, the prescribed culpable mental 
state applies to each such material element.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Except as provided in section 16-84, if the definition 
of an offense does not expressly 
prescribe a culpable mental state, a culpable mental state is nonetheless required and is 
established if a person acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly, but criminal negligence is not 
sufficient.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If the definition of an offense prescribes criminal negligence 
as the culpable mental state, it 
is also established if a person acts purposely or knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness 
suffices to establish a culpable mental state, it is also established if a person acts purposely or 
knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish a culpable mental state, it is also 
established if a person acts purposely.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Knowledge that conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge 
of the existence, meaning or 
application of the statute defining an offense is not an element of an offense unless the ordinance 
clearly so provides.</div>
