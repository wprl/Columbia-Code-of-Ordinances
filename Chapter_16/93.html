<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It is an affirmative defense that the defendant engaged 
in the conduct charged to constitute 
an offense because he was coerced to do so, by the use of, or threatened imminent use of, 
unlawful physical force upon him or a third person, which force or threatened force a person of 
reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The defense of duress, as defined in paragraph (a) of 
this section, is not available as to any 
offense when the defendant recklessly places himself in a situation in which it is probable that he 
will be subjected to the force or threatened force described in paragraph (a) of this section.</div>
