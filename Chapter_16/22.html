<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the same conduct of a person may establish the commission 
of more than one offense he 
may be prosecuted for each such offense. He may not, however, be convicted of more than one 
offense if:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One offense is included in the 
other, as defined in section 16-23; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inconsistent findings of fact 
are required to establish the commission of the offenses; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offenses differ only in that 
one is defined to prohibit a designated kind of conduct 
generally and the other to prohibit a specific instance of such conduct; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offense is defined as a continuing 
course of conduct and the person's course of 
conduct was uninterrupted, unless the law provides that specific periods of such conduct 
constitute separate offenses.</div>
