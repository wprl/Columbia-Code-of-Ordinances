&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this section is to ensure that adults 
as defined by state criminal statutes</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
, 
other than those excluded herein,</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;are not arrested and suffer only a fine and/or community 
service or counseling and no other punishment or penalty, for the possession of a misdemeanor 
amount of marijuana and/or marijuana paraphernalia. This section shall be liberally construed for 
the accomplishment of these purposes.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any law enforcement officer suspects any adult 
as defined by state criminal 
statutes</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">

&nbsp;of possession of a misdemeanor amount of marijuana 
and/or possession of marijuana paraphernalia, that person shall not be required to post bond, 
suffer arrest, be taken into custody for any purpose nor detained for any reason other than the 
issuance of a summons, suffer incarceration, suffer loss of driver's license, or any other 
punishment or penalty other than the issuance of a summons and, if found guilty, a fine of up to 
two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). There shall be a strong presumption that the proper 
disposition of any such case is to suspend the imposition of sentence and/or require community 
service work and/or drug counseling and education. All such matters shall only be referred to the 
municipal prosecuting attorney, and no other prosecuting attorney, and the municipal prosecuting 
attorney shall not refer the matter to any other prosecutor, agency, or office, unless </span></font><span

within the preceding ten (10) years; or</div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have been found guilty in 
a state court of a Class A misdemeanor, other than 
misdemeanor marijuana possession or misdemeanor possession of marijuana paraphernalia, 
within the preceding five (5) years; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have been found guilty in 
a state or municipal court of misdemeanor marijuana 
possession on two or more prior occasions within the preceding five (5) years; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are arrested on suspicion 
of any felony or misdemeanor offense chargeable only 
under state law, arising from the same set of facts and circumstances as the alleged marijuana 
offense.</div>

) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message of this section is that people should not use marijuana, but should 
also not 
lose opportunities for education and employment because of such use. The limited resources of 
law enforcement should be directed primarily toward crimes of violence or property loss. The 
enforcement of laws against marijuana shall be </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
