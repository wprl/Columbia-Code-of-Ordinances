<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in sections 16-171 through 16-173, the following 
terms shall have the meaning given 
in this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Appropriate</i> means to take, obtain, use, transfer, conceal or retain possession of.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Coercion.</i> Coercion means a threat, however communicated:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To commit any crime; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inflict physical injury in 
the future on the person threatened or another; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accuse any person of any crime; 
or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expose any person to hatred,

<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To harm the credit or business 
repute of any person; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take or withhold action as

withhold action; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inflict any other harm which 
would not benefit the actor.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>A threat of accusation, lawsuit or other invocation of official action is not coercion 
if the 
property sought to be obtained by virtue of such threat was honestly claimed as restitution or 
indemnification for harm done in the circumstances to which the accusation, exposure, lawsuit or 
other official action relates, or as compensation for property or lawful service. The defendant 
shall have the burden of injecting the issue of justification as to any threat.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Deceit.</i> &quot;Deceit&quot; means purposely making a representation which is false and which the 
actor 
does not believe to be true and upon which the victim relies, as to a matter of fact, law, value, 
intention or other state of mind. The term &quot;deceit&quot; does not, however, include falsity as 
to 
matters having no pecuniary significance, or puffing by statements unlikely to deceive ordinary 
persons in the group addressed. Deception as to the actor's intention to perform a promise shall 
not be inferred from the fact alone that he did not subsequently perform the promise.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">

payment of reward or other compensation; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use or dispose of property 
in a manner that makes recovery of the property by the 
owner unlikely.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Of another.</i> Property is that &quot;of another&quot; if any natural person, corporation, partnership, 
association, governmental subdivision or instrumentality, other than the actor, has possessory or 
proprietary interest therein, except that, for purposes of sections 16-161 through 16-163, property 
shall not be deemed property of another who has only a security interest therein, even if legal 
title is in the creditor pursuant to a conditional sales contract or other security arrangement.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Property.</i> &quot;Property&quot; means anything of value whether real or personal, tangible or 
intangible, 
in possession or in action, and shall include, but not be limited to, the evidence of a debt actually
