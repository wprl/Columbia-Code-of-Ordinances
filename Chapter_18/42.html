A covered police employee shall be eligible to receive retirement benefits upon reaching

&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this section and eligibility to retire after having completed twenty

which qualifies under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (38 
U.S.C. 4301, et seq.) as now enacted, or hereafter amended (USERRA), only to the extent any 
contributions required under section 18-40 of this Code are made to the police retirement fund 
either during the period of qualified military service under USERRA or within five (5) years 
from the date of reemployment.</span></div>

The administrator shall pay to a retiree, retired on account of age or service, retirement 
benefits determined by subsections (1) or (2) below. &nbsp;The plan benefits of subsection (1) below 
apply to employees hired after October 1, 1991 and employees employed on October 1, 1991 
who elected the benefits of subsection (1). &nbsp;The plan benefits of subsection (2) below apply to

A retiree retired due to age or service shall receive three (3) per cent of highest average 
salary per year of covered employment up to twenty (20) years. For each year of service in 
covered employment over twenty (20), the retiree shall receive an additional two (2) per cent of 
highest average salary per year, up to a maximum of seventy (70) per cent for twenty-five (25) 
years of service. This benefit shall continue for life. &nbsp;In the first month of each plan year, 
the 
retirement benefit shall be increased by 0.6% (i.e. annual compound COLA).</span></font></div>

A retiree covered under this option of the plan shall receive, up to age sixty-two (62), 
three (3) per cent of highest average salary per year of covered employment up to twenty (20) 
years. For each year of service in covered employment over twenty (20), the retiree shall receive 
an additional two (2) per cent of highest average salary per year, up to a maximum of seventy 
(70) per cent for twenty-five (25) years of service. In addition, a covered police employee retiring 
prior to age sixty-two (62) according to the eligibility requirements of this plan shall receive an 
increase in the first month of each plan year after retirement of two (2) per cent of the retirement 
benefits per year up to age sixty-two (62). After age sixty-two (62), all employees retired under 
this option shall receive two and twenty hundredths (2.20) per cent of the highest average salary 
times the number of years of continuous service up to twenty (20) years. For each year over 
twenty (20), one and seventy hundredths (1.70) per cent of highest average salary is added. The 
maximum benefit is fifty-two and five tenths (52.5) per cent of highest average salary with 
twenty-five (25) years of continuous service. The benefit calculated at age sixty-two (62) is then 
increased by two (2) per cent for each year from retirement to age sixty-one (61). The benefits 
calculated at age sixty-two (62) shall be increased each future year of retirement by two (2) per 
cent. The benefit calculated at age sixty-two (62) is then payable from age sixty-two (62) and 
increased in each future year by two (2) per cent of the preceding year's benefit amount.</span></font></div>

If, when a covered police employee&#146;s employment is terminated, the reserve value of the 
employee&#146;s retirement benefits is less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), the administrator 
shall pay the employee the amount of the reserve value in a single lump sum payment. &nbsp;&#147;Reserve 
value&#148; is the actuarial equivalent of the pension benefits the covered police employee would 
otherwise be eligible to receive under the police retirement plan. &nbsp;The single lump sum payment 
shall be made as soon as possible after employment is terminated and shall be in lieu of all other 
retirement benefits otherwise due the employee under the police retirement plan. &nbsp;The single 
lump sum payment shall be a complete discharge of all liabilities of the police retirement fund to 
the employee. &nbsp;This subsection shall not apply to covered police employees who retire on 
disability.</span></font></div>

options in the 
police retirement plan inconsistent with the provisions of section 401(a)(9) of the code are
