<p class=texthead>Section 18-112 Refunds.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the covered employment of 
a covered firefighter employee ends, the employee 
shall, have the right to withdraw in a lump sum from the fund contributions which the employee 
made. The lump sum withdrawal shall include interest on the contribution at the annual 
investment rate of return of the fund as determined by the annual actuarial report for each year in 
which contributions were made by the covered employee, compounded annually from the last 
day of the calendar year in which such covered employee contributions are made to the date of 
withdrawal. Withdrawal of contributions by a covered firefighter employee under this division 
shall terminate all rights to benefits unless reinstated as herein provided.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A covered firefighter employee 
who has withdrawn the contributions made by the 
employee with interest under the provisions of subsection (a) or received a lump-sum distribution 
under section 18-107(e) may, in the event of reemployment as a covered employee, reinstate 
benefits thereby forfeited within twelve (12) months from the date of reemployment by repaying 
to the fund the contributions and interest withdrawn from the fund or the lump-sum distribution, 
plus interest on the sum in the amount of the annual investment rate of return of the fund as 
determined by the annual actuarial report for each year that the contribution remained withdrawn 
from the fund, compounded annually from the date the sum was withdrawn or lump-sum 
distribution was made to the date of repayment. The time which a covered firefighter is absent 
from covered employment shall not be deemed to be reinstated by the repayment of prior 
contributions. </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the covered employment of a 
covered firefighter employee is terminated by the 
employee's death and the employee is not entitled to plan benefits as provided in section 18-109(b), 
the contributions of the employee to this plan and any amounts contributed to this plan 
and picked up by the city under Code Section 414(h) for the deceased employee shall be 
refunded or distributed, upon request, to the estate of the deceased employee. Interest on the 
contributions or distributions so refunded shall be calculated as above.</div>
