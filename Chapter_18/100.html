<p class=texthead>Section 18-100 Benefits not assignable or subject to execution.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits payable from the police retirement fund shall not 
be assignable or subject to 
counter-claim, recoupment or set off. Except for qualified domestic relations orders, benefits 
payable from the police retirement fund shall not be subject to assessment, garnishment, 
execution, injunction, or any other decree, order, process, or proceeding in any court for the 
payment of any debt of any beneficiary, and the sum shall be held and distributed solely for the 
purpose of this article. This provision shall not prevent the police retirement board from pursuing 
a retiree or other beneficiary of the police retirement plan for recovery of benefits erroneously 
paid or to recover benefits paid due to fraud, duress or the concealment of any material fact 
necessary to properly process a claim for benefits.</div>
