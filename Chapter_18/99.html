<p class=texthead>Section 18-99 Refunds.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the covered employment of a 
covered police employee ends, the employee shall 
have the right to withdraw in a lump sum from the fund, contributions which the employee made. 
The lump sum withdrawal shall include interest on the contribution at the annual investment rate 
of return of the fund as determined by the annual actuarial report for each year in which 
contributions were made by the covered employee, compounded annually from the last day of the 
calendar year in which such covered employee contributions are made to the date of withdrawal. 
Withdrawal of contributions by a covered police employee under this ordinance shall terminate 
all rights to benefits unless reinstated as herein provided.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A covered police employee who has 
withdrawn the contributions made by the employee 
with interest under provisions of subsection (a) hereof or received a lump-sum distribution under 
section 18-94(e) may, in the event of reemployment as a covered employee, reinstate benefits 
thereby forfeited within twelve (12) months from the date of reemployment by repaying to the 
fund the contributions and interest withdrawn from the fund or the lump-sum distribution, plus 
interest on the sum in the amount of the annual investment rate of return of the fund as 
determined by the annual actuarial report for each year that the contribution remained withdrawn 
from the fund, compounded annually from the date the sum was withdrawn or lump-sum 
distribution was made to the date of repayment. The time which a covered police employee is 
absent from covered employment shall not be deemed to be reinstated by the repayment of prior 
contributions.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the covered employment of a covered 
police employee is terminated by the employee's 
death and the employee is not entitled to plan benefits other than the funeral benefit authorized 
by section 18-96(5), the contributions of the employee to this plan and any amounts contributed 
to this plan and picked up by the city under Code Section 414(h) for the deceased employee shall 
be refunded or distributed, upon request, to the estate of the deceased employee. Interest on the 
contributions or distributions so refunded shall be calculated as above.</div>
