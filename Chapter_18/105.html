<i>Covered firefighter employee.</i> A person hired by the Columbia Fire Department as a full-time,

duties of the employee's covered employment at some definite time and place. Duty-related 
disability or death shall include a disability or death which results from a disease contracted or an 
injury sustained by an off-duty covered employee acting under color of the employee's 
commission. A disability or death resulting from a disease contracted or an injury sustained by an 
off-duty covered employee while in paid employment of another entity shall only be considered a 
duty-related disability or death if the covered employee was acting under color of the employee's

firefighter employee's salary was the highest, or, if the employee has less than thirty-six (36) 
months of service, then the average salary over the employee's entire period of service. For the 
purposes of calculating the thirty-six (36) months of highest average salary, no period shorter
