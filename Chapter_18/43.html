the combination of disability retirement benefits provided herein, social security, workers' 
compensation benefits, other long-term disability benefits, and compensation for other 
employment. After a retiree accumulates twenty (20) years of combined service in covered

In the event of a lump sum Workers' Compensation settlement, the amount of the

determined by converting the lump sum Workers' Compensation amount to a single life monthly 
annuity of equivalent value for the benefit recipient, using the mortality table and interest rate 
used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the fund. For purposes of this section, future 
medical awards shall not be considered a part of Workers' Compensation benefits or entitlements. 
In addition, the monthly disability benefit shall be reduced by the amount of the single life 
monthly annuity as determined herein.</span></div>

benefit, the administrator shall from time to time, 
review the disability of the retiree to determine whether or not the disability continues to exist. 
Reexamination shall take place at least once each year unless the board shall determine 
otherwise. The administrator may require any retiree receiving a disability benefit to undergo a 
medical examination to review the status of the disability. The administrator may request the 
retiree to undergo an examination with a doctor of the retiree&#146;s choosing and at the retiree&#146;s 
expense or may require a medical examination with a doctor of the administrator's choosing at 
the expense of the police retirement fund.</div>

a medical examination after ten (10) days' written notice

until such time as the retiree submits to the required examination. If such refusal continues for 
one calendar year from the date of notice, all rights to any benefits shall immediately cease and 
the retiree&#146;s benefits schedule shall escheat to the police retirement fund.</div>

the reexamination shows that the disability no longer exists, the right to benefits 
for disability shall immediately cease. A hearing on the continuance of the disability may be had 
before the administrator upon the retiree&#146;s written request within ten (10) days of the 
administrator's notification.</div>
