value&#148; is the actuarial equivalent of the pension benefits the covered firefighter employee would 
otherwise be eligible to receive under the firefighters&#146; retirement plan. &nbsp;The single lump 
sum 
payment shall be made as soon as possible after employment is terminated and shall be in lieu of 
all other retirement benefits otherwise due the employee under the firefighters&#146; retirement plan. 
The single lump sum payment shall be a complete discharge of all liabilities of the firefighters&#146; 
retirement fund to the employee. &nbsp;This subsection shall not apply to covered firefighter 
employees who retire on disability.</span></font></div>
