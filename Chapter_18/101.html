<p class=texthead>Section 18-101 Miscalculation of benefits, payment of interest on underpayment or overpayment.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a miscalculation of benefits due a retiree or beneficiary 
which results in an 
underpayment is discovered, interest on the underpayment shall be paid to the retiree or 
beneficiary at a rate equal to the annual investment rate of return on the police retirement fund as 
determined by the annual actuarial statement for each year of the underpayment. Whenever an 
overpayment is discovered, the retiree or beneficiary shall repay the amount erroneously paid in 
excess of the benefit due him plus interest for the time of overpayment equal to the annual 
investment rate of return on the fund as determined by the annual actuarial statement for each 
year of overpayment. &nbsp;If the amount of overpayment and interest thereon is greater than one (1) 
monthly benefit payment, repayment shall be made to the fund in the same manner as provided 
for reimbursement by the retiree of lump sum worker's compensation benefits in section 18-97 of 
this article.</div>
