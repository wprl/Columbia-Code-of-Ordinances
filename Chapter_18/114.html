<p class=texthead>Section 18-114 Miscalculation of benefits, payment of interest on under or overpayment.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a miscalculation of benefits due a retiree or beneficiary 
which results in an 
underpayment is discovered, interest on the underpayment shall be paid to the retiree or 
beneficiary at a rate equal to the annual investment rate of return on the firefighters' retirement 
fund as determined by the annual actuarial statement for each year of the underpayment. 
Whenever an overpayment is discovered, the retiree or beneficiary shall repay the amount 
erroneously paid in excess of the benefit due him plus interest for the time of overpayment equal 
to the annual investment rate of return on the fund as determined by the annual actuarial 
statement for each year of overpayment. If the amount of overpayment and interest thereon is 
greater than one (1) monthly benefit payment, repayment shall be made to the fund by deduction 
from the monthly retirement benefit a single life monthly annuity which has been determined 
from the value of the amount of overpayment and interest thereon using the mortality tables and 
accepted actuarial standards.</div>
