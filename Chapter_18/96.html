<p class=texthead>Section 18-96 Death benefits.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the death of a covered police employee or retiree, there 
shall be paid to the surviving 
spouse and unmarried minor children a benefit from the police retirement fund, from Workers' 
Compensation and from Social Security, or from some combination thereof, as below described:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be paid to the surviving spouse of a covered 
police employee a monthly benefit 
equal to one-half (1/2) of the retirement benefit to which the deceased employee would have 
been entitled had the employee met the age or service requirement on the date of the employee's 
death. The benefit paid to the surviving spouse shall not be reduced by any Social Security 
entitlement; provided, however, that the benefit paid from the police retirement fund when added 
to the Social Security entitlement shall not exceed ninety (90) percent of the salary which the 
covered police employee was receiving immediately prior to death.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be paid to the surviving spouse of a retiree 
a monthly benefit equal to one-half 
(1/2) of the retirement benefit to which the deceased retiree was receiving immediately prior to 
death. The benefit paid to the surviving spouse shall not be reduced by any Social Security 
entitlement; provided, however, that the benefit paid from the police retirement benefit when 
added to the Social Security entitlement shall not exceed ninety (90) percent of the salary which 
the deceased retiree was receiving immediately prior to retirement. &nbsp;The surviving spouse benefit 
under this subsection shall be the actuarial equivalent of the fifty (50) percent joint and survivor 
annuity under section 18-94. &nbsp;The actuarial equivalent shall be based on assumptions for the 
&#147;applicable interest rate&#148; and &#147;applicable mortality table&#148; as determined under 
Code Section 
417(e).</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no surviving spouse eligible to receive benefits 
under the provisions of this 
subsection, the surviving unmarried children under the age of eighteen (18) shall divide equally 
the benefit to which a surviving spouse would have been entitled. The death benefit shall be 
payable upon the last day of the month immediately following the month in which the death 
occurred.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon remarriage of the surviving spouse of a covered police 
employee or retiree, benefits 
allowed under this section shall cease if the surviving spouse was not married to and living with 
the covered police employee or retiree for a period of at least two (2) years prior to the death of 
the covered police employee or retiree.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the surviving spouse is over forty (40) years of age 
at the time of remarriage, benefits 
provided under this section shall continue for the life of the surviving spouse.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the surviving spouse is under forty (40) years of age 
upon remarriage, then benefits to 
which the spouse is entitled shall continue for a period of ten (10) years after the remarriage.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a covered police employee 
or a retiree dies without a surviving spouse or other 
survivor entitled to benefits under this section, there shall be paid a funeral benefit of one 
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The funeral benefit shall be paid to the personal representative of 
the estate of the deceased employee, or if no personal representative has been appointed within 
forty-five (45) days of death, then to the person who actually paid the funeral and burial expense 
with respect to such deceased person, upon proof of such payments, or, if proof of such payment 
has not been made within sixty (60) days after such death, then to the mortuary that actually 
incurred the expense of the funeral and burial of such deceased person.</div>
