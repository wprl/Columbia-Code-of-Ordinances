<p class=texthead>Section 18-93 Contributions to the police retirement fund.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered police employees shall be 
assessed and required to pay into the fund four and 
five-tenths (4.5) percent of compensation. &#147;Compensation,&#148; as used in this subsection, includes 
salary, wages, overtime pay, amounts contributed to a cafeteria plan under Code Section 125, 
amounts contributed to a deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457, amounts 
contributed to this plan on behalf of a covered employee and picked up by the city under Code 
Section 414(h), sick leave buy back payments, automobile allowance payments, and cash in lieu 
of vacation paid under section 19-129(b) of the city code. &nbsp;Compensation does not include 
payment for unused vacation days or unused floating holidays, workers compensation payments, 
safety awards, or any other payment or benefit not listed in this subsection.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributions of covered police 
employees shall be deducted from their biweekly 
compensation and placed in the police retirement fund. Deduction of contributions shall be a 
term and condition of employment; acceptance and continuance in employment shall be deemed 
to be the assent of an employee to deductions.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shall pick up employee contributions 
required of covered police employees. The 
contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax 
treatment under the Code. The city shall pick up these contributions from funds established and 
available, which funds would otherwise have been designated as employee contributions and 
paid to the retirement fund.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code, these employee contributions 
so picked up shall not be 
included in gross income for tax purposes until such time as they are distributed by refund or 
benefit payment.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shall pay into the police 
retirement fund all amounts that are needed, in addition 
to the contributions of covered police employees, to make the fund actuarially and financially 
sound.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator, shall return to 
the appropriate city fund any city contribution made by 
mistake.</div>
