<p class=texthead>Section 18-95 Disability benefits.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A covered police employee who 
sustains a duty-related disability, or a covered police 
employee having completed one (1) continuous year or more of covered employment who 
sustains a nonduty-related disability, shall be entitled to the disability benefit set out in this 
section. The covered police employee shall be entitled to the disability benefit only while the 
disease or injury renders the employee unfit for the regular duties of the employee's covered 
employment.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the termination of the disability, payment of the benefit 
shall cease; provided, however, 
that no disability shall be deemed to have terminated so long as the covered police employee is 
unable to return to the employee's former regular duties solely because of the disability or a 
residual effect thereof. Upon termination of a disability, no right of automatic reemployment 
exists. Reemployment shall be governed by the provisions of the city's personnel code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible covered police employees 
shall be paid from the police retirement fund, from 
Workers' Compensation benefits, from Social Security benefits or from some combination 
thereof, the following benefits:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a covered police employee, disabled with a duty-related 
disability, a disability benefit 
equal to fifty (50) percent of the employee's highest average salary plus ten (10) percent of that 
salary for each unmarried dependent child under the age of eighteen (18), to an amount not to 
exceed ninety (90) percent of the employee's highest average salary. Such benefit shall be 
payable monthly.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a covered police employee, disabled with a nonduty-related 
disability, a disability 
benefit equal to two and one-half (2.5) percent of the employee's highest average salary per year 
of covered employment plus an additional one-half (0.5) percent of that salary per year for each 
unmarried dependent child under the age of eighteen (18), up to a maximum of four (4) children. 
Such benefit shall be payable monthly.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty and nonduty-related disability benefits paid to any 
covered police employee shall be 
offset dollar for dollar by the excess of income received by the retiree over ninety (90) percent of 
the employee's highest average salary. For purposes of this section, income shall be defined as 
the combination of disability retirement benefits provided herein, social security, workers' 
compensation benefits, other long-term disability benefits, and compensation for other 
employment. After a retiree accumulates twenty-five (25) years of combined service in covered 
employment and time receiving disability benefits or age sixty-five (65), the income offset shall 
cease.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a lump sum Workers' Compensation settlement, 
the amount of the monthly 
income to be used as income offset in the disability retirement benefit shall be determined by 
converting the lump sum Workers' Compensation amount to a single life monthly annuity of 
equivalent value for the benefit recipient, using the mortality table and interest rate used in the 
most recent actuarial valuation of the fund. For purposes of this section, future medical awards 
shall not be considered a part of Workers' Compensation benefits or entitlements. In addition, the 
monthly disability benefit shall be reduced by the amount of the single life monthly annuity as 
determined herein.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of calculating the income offset for disability 
retirement benefits, the final 
average salary shall be adjusted on the anniversary date of the retiree's becoming eligible for 
disability retirement benefits by the percentage change in the consumer price index for this 
region of the country from January 1 of the previous year to January 1 of the current year.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who receives disability benefits for a duty-related 
disability shall receive 
credit for covered employment for each year of duty-related disability retirement up to a 
maximum, when combined with years of actual covered employment, of twenty-five (25) years. 
At that point disability retirement benefits shall cease and the retiree shall receive retirement 
benefits based on years of service.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who is receiving nonduty-related disability 
benefits may, upon reaching age 
sixty-five (65) years, elect to receive, in lieu thereof, retirement benefits based on age.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the approval of any disability 
benefit, the administrator shall, from time to time, 
review the disability of the retiree to determine whether or not the disability continues to exist. 
Reexamination shall take place at least once each year unless the board shall determine 
otherwise. The administrator may require any retiree receiving a disability benefit to undergo a 
medical examination to review the status of the disability. The administrator may request the 
retiree to undergo an examination with a doctor of the retiree's choosing and at the retiree's 
expense or may require a medical examination with a doctor of the administrator's choosing at 
the expense of the police retirement fund.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any retiree refusing to submit to a medical examination 
after ten (10) days' written notice 
from the administrator shall waive and forfeit all rights to benefits from the date of the notice 
until such time as the retiree submits to the required examination. If such refusal continues for 
one (1) calendar year from the date of notice, all rights to any benefits shall immediately cease 
and the retiree's benefits schedule shall escheat to the police retirement fund.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the reexamination shows that the disability no longer 
exists, the right to benefits for 
disability shall immediately cease. A hearing on the continuance of the disability may be had 
before the administrator upon the retiree's written request within ten (10) days of the 
administrator's notification.</div>
