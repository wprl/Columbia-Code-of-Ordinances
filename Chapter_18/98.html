<p class=texthead>Section 18-98 Applications for benefits.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for benefits to be paid 
from the retirement fund must be made upon the 
forms provided by the administrator and contain full information from which the board may 
determine the eligibility of the applicant. If such application be founded upon disability, full 
information concerning the nature and extent of the injury must be furnished with the 
application, and the applicant must likewise submit to examination by a physician designated by 
the administrator. The administrator may hold hearings and take and preserve evidence touching 
the nature and extent of injuries upon which claims for benefits on account of disability are 
claimed, and may thereafter approve or deny such application.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than one (1) monthly payment 
shall be made at any time; no payment shall be 
made more than ten (10) days in advance of the period to which it applies. This provision shall 
not prevent the lump sum settlement of past liability for benefits.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any claimant denied benefits by a 
decision of the administrator or any claimant or 
covered police employee or retiree otherwise aggrieved by any decision of the administrator may 
appeal such decision to the police retirement board. Such appeal must be in writing and filed 
within ten (10) days of the date of the administrator's decision. The board shall hold a hearing, 
take evidence and render a written decision including findings of fact and conclusions of law. 
Such decision shall be appealable by any person aggrieved by any decision of the police 
retirement board or by the administrator under the provisions of the Missouri Administrative 
Procedure Act.</div>
