<p class=texthead>Section 18-106 Contributions to the firefighters' retirement fund.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of each covered 
firefighter employee shall be four (4) percent of the 
employee's compensation. &quot;Compensation,&quot; as used in this subsection, includes salary, wages, 
overtime pay, amounts contributed to a cafeteria plan under Code Section 125, amounts 
contributed to a deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457, and any amounts 
contributed to this plan on behalf of a covered employee and picked up by the city under Code 
Section 414(h), sick leave buy back payments, automobile allowance payments, and cash in lieu 
of vacation payments under section 19-129(b). Compensation does not include payment for 
unused vacation days or unused floating holidays, workers compensation payments, safety 
awards, or any other payment or benefit not listed in this subsection.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributions of covered firefighter 
employees shall be deducted from their biweekly 
compensation and placed in the firefighters' retirement fund. Deduction of contributions shall be 
a term and condition of employment; acceptance and continuance in employment shall be 
deemed to be the assent of an employee to deductions.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shall pick up employee 
contributions required of covered firefighter employees. 
The contributions so picked-up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax 
treatment under the code. The city-shall pick up the contributions from funds established and 
available, which funds would otherwise have been designated as employee contributions and 
paid to the retirement fund.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code, these employee contributions 
so picked up shall not be 
included in gross income for tax purposes until such time as they are distributed by refund or 
benefit payment.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city shall pay into the firefighters' 
retirement fund all amounts that are needed, in 
addition to the contributions of covered firefighter employees, to make the fund actuarially and 
financially sound.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator shall return 
to the appropriate city fund any city contribution made by 
mistake.</div>
