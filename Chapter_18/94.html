<p class=texthead>Section 18-94 Retirement by reason of age or service.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A covered, police employee shall 
be eligible to receive retirement benefits upon reaching 
the age of sixty-five (65) or upon having completed twenty&#150;five (25) years of active service 
without regard to age. &nbsp;For purposes of this section and eligibility to retire after having completed 
twenty-five (25) years of active service without regard to age, active service shall include 
military leave which qualifies under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment 
Rights Act (38 U.S.C. 4301, et seq.) as now enacted, or hereafter amended (USERRA), only to 
the extent any contributions required under section 18-93 are made to the police retirement fund 
either during the period of qualified military service under USERRA or within five (5) years 
from the date of reemployment.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A former covered police employee 
shall be eligible to receive retirement benefits upon 
reaching the age of sixty-five (65).</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator shall pay to 
a retiree, retired on account of age or service, retirement 
benefits determined by subsection (1) below. &nbsp;The plan benefits of subsection (1) below apply to 
employees hired on or after October 1, 2012.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A retiree retired due to age or service shall receive 
two (2) percent of highest average salary 
per year of covered employment up to twenty-five (25) years. For each year of service in covered 
employment over twenty-five (25), the retiree shall receive an additional one and five-tenths 
(1.5) percent of highest average salary per year, up to a maximum of fifty-seven and five-tenths 
(57.5) percent for twenty-five (25) years of service. This benefit shall continue for life. In the 
first month of each plan year, the retirement benefit shall be increased by six tenths (0.6) percent 
(i.e. annual compound COLA).</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon approval of any application 
for benefits by the administrator, the applicant shall be 
entitled to receive monthly benefit payments beginning on the last day of the month immediately 
following the month in which employment ends. &nbsp;A married retiree eligible for survivor benefits 
under section 18-47(2) shall receive a fifty (50) percent joint and survivor annuity which is the 
actuarial equivalent of a single life annuity under this section. &nbsp;The actuarial equivalent shall 
be 
based on assumptions for the &#147;applicable interest rate&#148; and &#147;applicable mortality table&#148; 
as 
determined under Code Section 417(e).</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, when a covered police employee's 
employment is terminated, and the reserve value of 
the employee's retirement benefits is less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), the 
administrator shall pay the employee the amount of the reserve value in a single lump sum 
payment. &quot;Reserve value&quot; is the actuarial equivalent of the pension benefits the covered police 
employee would otherwise be eligible to receive under the police retirement plan. The single 
lump sum payment shall be made as soon as possible after employment is terminated and shall be 
in lieu of all other retirement benefits otherwise due the employee under the police retirement 
plan. The single lump sum payment shall be a complete discharge of all liabilities of the police 
retirement fund to the employee. This subsection shall not apply to covered police employees 
who retire on disability.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the requirements 
of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code, distribution of 
retirement benefits under this section shall begin no later than April 1 of the year in which the 
retiree either attains age seventy and one-half (70&#189;) or retires, whichever is later. Any 
distribution options in the police retirement plan inconsistent with the provisions of Section 
401(a)(9) of the Code are overridden by the provisions of the Code.</div>
