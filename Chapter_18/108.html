<p class=texthead>Section 18-108 Disability benefits.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A covered firefighter employee who 
contracts a disease or sustains accidental injuries 
resulting in disability while in the actual discharge and performance of the duties of the 
employee's covered employment at some definite time and place, or a covered firefighter 
employee having completed one (1) continuous year or more of covered employment who 
contracts a disease or sustains accidental injuries resulting in disability at any time, shall be 
entitled to the disability benefit set out in this section. The covered firefighter employee shall be 
entitled to the disability benefit only while the disease or injury renders the employee unfit for 
the regular duties of the employee's covered employment.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the termination of the disability, payment of the benefit 
shall cease; provided, however, 
that no disability shall be deemed to have terminated so long as the covered firefighter employee 
is unable to return to the employee's former regular duties as a firefighter solely because of the 
disability or a residual effect thereof. Upon termination of a disability, no right of automatic 
reemployment exists. Reemployment shall be governed by the provisions of the city's personnel 
code. If a formerly disabled employee ceases to be disabled and is again available for 
employment with the city, the board or the administrator shall immediately notify the city human 
resources department of that availability. With the permission of the employee, medical records 
of the board shall be forwarded which document that availability.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A covered firefighter employee shall 
be paid from the firefighters&#146; retirement fund the 
following benefits:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a covered firefighter employee, disabled with a duty-related 
disability, a disability 
benefit equal to two and five-tenths (2.5) percent of the employee's highest average salary 
multiplied by the number of years of active service counted as if the employee had worked to age 
sixty (60). Such benefit shall be payable monthly.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a covered firefighter employee, disabled with a nonduty-related 
disability, a disability 
benefit equal to two and five-tenths (2.5) percent of the employee's highest average salary 
multiplied by the number of years of active service at the time of disability retirement. Such 
benefit shall be payable monthly.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person receiving the disability 
benefit is eligible for the retirement benefit due to 
age or service, the person shall receive the greater of (i) the disability benefit being received, or 
(ii) the age or service benefit. &nbsp;Eligibility for retirement due to service shall be based on years 
of 
active service plus years of service accrued while on disability retirement. The age or service 
benefit shall be based on salary at the time of termination of employment and years of active 
service plus years of service accrued while on disability retirement.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the approval of any disability 
benefit, the administrator shall, from time to time, 
review the disability of a retiree to determine whether or not the disability continues to exist. 
Reexamination shall take place at least once each year unless the board shall determine 
otherwise. The administrator may require any retiree receiving a disability benefit to undergo a 
medical examination to review the status of the disability. The administrator may request the 
retiree to undergo an examination with a doctor of the retiree's choosing and at the retiree's 
expense or may require a medical examination with a doctor of the administrator's choosing at 
the expense of the firefighters' retirement fund.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any retiree refusing to submit to a medical examination 
after ten (10) days' written notice 
from the administrator shall waive and forfeit all rights to benefits from the date of the notice 
until such time as the retiree submits to the required examination. If such refusal continues for 
one (1) calendar year from the date of notice, all rights to any benefits shall immediately cease 
and the retiree's benefits shall escheat to the firefighters' retirement fund.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the reexamination shows that the disability no longer 
exists, the right to benefits for 
disability shall immediately cease. A hearing on the continuance of the disability may be had 
before the administrator upon the retiree's written request made within ten (10) days of the 
administrator's notification.</div>
