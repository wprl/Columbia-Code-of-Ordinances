<p class=texthead>Section 17-150 Tax bills; form and content.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tax bill shall contain a brief general statement of 
the facts authorizing its issue, the 
amount for which it is issued, the name of the record owner and the description of the property 
against which it is issued, the rate of interest which it bears, when it begins to bear interest, and 
shall state that it is a lien against the land therein described, and give the time that the lien 
continues. Tax bills shall bear no interest for sixty (60) days after the date of issue, at which time 
such tax bills shall be due and payable in full. After the expiration of sixty (60) days, tax bills 
shall bear interest, on the unpaid balance, at a rate of nine (9) percent, which rate shall be set 
forth in the ordinance authorizing the issuance thereof. Every tax bill shall be a lien against the 
lot, tract or parcel of land described therein for a period of ten (10) years after date of issue, 
unless sooner paid. The lien, for tax bills payable in installments, shall expire one (1) year after 
the date of maturity of the last installment, except when it becomes necessary to bring suit to 
enforce the lien, in which case the lien shall continue until the expiration of the litigation. If the 
property owner cannot be served by legal process, a suit may be brought by attachment or by any 
other legal remedy. Tax bills shall be prima facie evidence of what they contain, of their own 
validity and of the facts authorizing their issue. No mere informality or clerical mistake in any of 
the proceedings shall be a defense thereto. Any error made in issuing any tax bill may be 
corrected by the city clerk, either by interlineation or by issuing a new tax bill in lieu of the 
erroneous one. When a tax bill is corrected by interlineation, the date of making same shall be 
certified by the clerk on the margin or back of the bill. In any action brought on any tax bill, the 
court shall have the authority to correct any error in the tax bill.</div>
