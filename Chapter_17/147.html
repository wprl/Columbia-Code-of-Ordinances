<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before authorizing the purchase of any land for open space 
or park purposes which is to be 
paid for in whole or in part by special assessments, the city council shall hold a public hearing on 
the matter. All interested persons shall be given an opportunity to be heard at the public hearing. 
Notice of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 
seven (7) days before the hearing. The notice shall describe generally the land to be purchased 
and the boundaries of the proposed benefit district. The notice shall also set forth the proposed 
formula for imposing special assessments which may be based on the square footage or the 
assessed value of the property charged or any other reasonable method of calculation. If, after the 
public hearing, the city council desires to proceed with the purchase of the land, it shall, by 
ordinance, authorize the city manager to acquire the property.</div>
