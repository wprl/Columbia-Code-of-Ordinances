<p class=texthead>Section 1-5 Catchlines of sections; severability of parts of Code.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The catchlines of the several sections of this Code are 
intended as mere catchwords to 
indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, 
nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when 
any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city 
council that the sections, paragraphs, 
sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, 
paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or invalid by the valid 
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity 
shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this 
Code since the same would have been enacted by the city council without the incorporation in 
this Code of any such unconstitutional or invalid phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.</div>
