<p class=texthead>Section 1-6 Supplementation of Code.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this 
Code shall be prepared and printed 
whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all 
substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by 
initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made 
thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly 
into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially 
obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code 
will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the 
supplement.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions 
of the Code which have been repealed 
shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier 
(meaning the person, agency or 
organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in 
ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so 
to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organize the ordinance material 
into appropriate subdivisions;</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide appropriate catchlines, 
headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of 
the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign appropriate numbers to 
sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code 
and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision 
numbers;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the words &quot;this ordinance&quot; 
or words of the same meaning to &quot;this chapter, &quot; &quot;this 
article, &quot; &quot;this division, &quot; etc., as the case may be, or to &quot;sections ________ 
to ________ 
(inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive 
sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make other nonsubstantive changes 
necessary to preserve the original meaning of 
ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in 
the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in 
the Code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify><br></div>
