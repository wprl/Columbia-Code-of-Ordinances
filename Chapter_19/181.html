Any collective bargaining agreements which the city may enter into will be in accordance 
with the principles of placement, promotion and/or transfer of employees without regard to race, 
creed, color, marital status, national origin, political affiliation, religion, </span></font><span

<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The director will review job categories where few female 
and/or minority group members 
are presently employed, and seek to determine the cause of such situations when shown 
necessary by study of the available and qualified labor market. Remedial efforts may include 
such actions as the following:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More vigorous recruitment of qualified 
female and/or minority candidates.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special discussion with appropriate 
management, supervisory, and other personnel, 
regarding the city's policy and its desire to ensure full utilization of qualified female and/or 
minority group personnel in all operational areas.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluate qualifications of the 
lower echelon of female and/or minority group employees 
to determine whether under utilized skills and capabilities would potentially be more fully 
employed in other capacities, or would warrant their transfer to other types of jobs more readily 
leading to advancement. This practice shall be applied equally to all employees.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Placement, promotion, and transfer activities at all 
levels will be monitored to ensure that 
reasonable, equitable, fair consideration has been given to qualified female and/or minority group 
employees.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Subcontractors, vendors and suppliers shall be notified 
of the city's EEO affirmative action 
policy and requested to take appropriate EEO affirmative action within their own employment 
practices.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The director shall compile at least quarterly statistics 
concerning applicants, placement, 
and related employment data for the purpose of gauging the effectiveness of the EEO affirmative 
action program.</div>
