<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee eligible and registered to vote in any election 
held within this state, or any 
primary election held in preparation for such election, shall, on the day of such election, be 
entitled to leave from duty (if on duty) which would allow three (3) hours of voting time between 
the time of opening and the time of closing the polls. This section shall not apply to a voter on 
the day of election if there are three (3) successive hours, while the polls are open, in which 
he/she is not on duty. The duly authorized supervisor may specify any three (3) hours between 
the time of opening and closing of the polls during which an employee may be granted voting 
leave. Generally, such leave shall not exceed one hour of paid on-duty time for each election day. 
Exceptions may be arranged with the approval of the department head. Employees are required to 
show current, eligible voter registration cards to their supervisor prior to release for voting 
purposes; and no employee shall be granted time off with pay for voting who is not eligible to 
participate in a given election.</div>
