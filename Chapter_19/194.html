&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) At least fifteen (15) working days (three (3) calendar weeks for firefighting 
employees on 
continuous shift assignments) prior to the expiration of an employee's probationary or qualifying 
period, the department head shall notify the director in writing whether the services of the 
employee have been satisfactory and whether the department head desires to continue the 
employee in the position. A copy of such notice shall be given to the employee. Should the 
department head recommend the employee not be retained on a permanent basis, the employee 
shall be removed from the position. Employees who satisfactorily complete their probationary or 
qualifying period may be eligible to be considered for a salary adjustment, if their classification 
has such a provision in the pay plan, and shall be eligible for full grievance appeal and fringe 
benefit privileges. Employees serving a twelve (12) month probationary period shall be eligible 
for full benefit privileges, including possible salary adjustment, six (6) months through their 
twelve (12) months probationary or qualifying period. Employees serving an eighteen (18) month 
probationary or qualifying period shall be eligible for full benefit privileges after six (6) months 
and shall be eligible for possible salary adjustment after twelve (12) months. Employees shall not 
be eligible for appeal privileges until completion of the probationary or qualifying period.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The intent of subsection (a) of this section is to provide for the orderly 
administration of an 
employee's probationary period. Failure of the probationary employee's department to notify the 
director as required shall not shorten the probationary period or prevent the department from 
discharging the employee or extending the employee's probationary period after the 15-day report 
deadline but such action must occur prior to the scheduled expiration of the probationary period.</span></font></div>
