&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <i>Preamble.</i> The responsibility of protecting health and privacy rights 
of all people is 
fundamental. It is known that employees who carry the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are 
not dangerous to others through casual contact and, therefore, should not be treated differently. 
Individuals having a contagious secondary infection, however, could serve as a source of that 
infection to others and, in those instances, a policy for specific infections should be established 
and followed.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <i>Policy.</i> Each case involving HIV infection shall be evaluated separately 
in order to assess 
risks and benefits to the infected individual and to all others in the setting.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These evaluations shall be made by using a team approach 
involving the individual's 
physician, public health personnel, and the city human resources department. Other advisors may 
be included if considered appropriate by the city manager or his designee.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are determined to be physically 
able to work without presenting a 
danger to themselves will be allowed to do so.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those persons who have a need to know the identity 
of the HIV-infected individual, 
in order to detect potential for disease transmission, shall be advised of the individual's identity. 
The city manager or his designee shall be responsible for determining those who are to be 
informed of the HIV-infected individual's identity. No additional release of information shall be 
permitted without the written consent of the individual. The city manager or his designee is 
authorized to release general information, appropriate to the situation, consistent with 
maintaining the individual's privacy rights.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <i>Education.</i> An ongoing, educational program shall be conducted for 
all city employees.</span></font></div>
