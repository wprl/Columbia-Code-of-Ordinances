<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, 
abortion, and recovery 
therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as such 
under applicable provisions of these rules. Accrued leaves may be granted for preparation for or 
recovery from such situations. In addition a woman anticipating maternity may be entitled to a 
leave of absence. (See section 19-122.)</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) All employees requesting such leave shall notify the 
department head significantly in 
advance of the anticipated date of delivery, and employees may remain on the job as long as 
health permits. Employees granted such leave shall present a doctor's statement concerning status 
of the pregnancy, limitations imposed by the individual case, and recovery therefrom. Any 
employee who does not report back to work by the expiration date as set forth in the leave of 
absence notice, or does not receive an approved extension or who accepts other employment 
while on leave from the city, or who withdraws retirement savings, will be considered to have 
terminated employment with the city. Disposition of all requests for leaves of absence and 
extensions thereof shall be in writing and processed through the department head.</div>

a predetermined time to allow for 
prenatal necessities and postnatal child care, sick leave shall be granted only for such time as the
