<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on statistical employee turnover rates and anticipated, 
projected changes in total work 
force allocations; and work force evaluation in terms of race, sex, job position, salary make-up, 
and related considerations, annual and long-range (if practicable) EEO affirmative action goals 
will be recommended by the director in consultation with the respective department heads, 
reviewed by the personnel advisory board, and adopted by the city manager as an administrative 
policy. Documentation concerning the success of projected goal attainment shall be completed 
annually by the director, citing conditions and circumstances which may have helped or hindered 
the program. Subsequent goals and timetables shall be established considering the practical 
experience and preceding goal success. Identifiable lack of good faith in attempting to achieve 
established goals shall be just cause of disciplinary action, and shall involve any and all 
employees.</div>
