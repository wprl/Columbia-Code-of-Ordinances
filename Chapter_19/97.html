<p class=texthead>Section 19-97 Standby/on-call provisions.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A department head or duly authorized supervisor shall prepare a roster of 
employees 
assigned to standby duty. Employees shall receive, insofar as possible, a month's notice, and 
assignments shall be posted on accessible bulletin boards. Emergency employees such as police 
and fire may be excluded from this provision pursuant to departmental rules and regulations.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) All personnel assigned to standby shall be instructed that they must be 
easily reached, 
capable, sober and ready to work at any time during their standby period. This condition shall be 
a mandatory part of the assignment.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) No employee on standby duty is expected to attempt any procedure which the 
employee 
considers unsafe within requirements of the operation. If additional help is required to perform a 
job, the employee shall follow specified department procedures. Safety equipment and 
procedures shall be used as during regular working hours.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Standby duty normally shall be one week in duration, rotated among qualified 
employees. 
An employee shall be removed from standby duty if deemed incapable due to illness, or other 
sanctioned, cleared emergency as determined by the duly authorized supervisor; and remunerated 
on a daily basis. An employee must have been in pay status during the normal working day in 
order to be eligible for the daily &nbsp;thirteen dollars ($ 13.00) standby remuneration, except on 
weekends or normally scheduled days off. If an employee requests sick leave during a part or 
whole day standby duty is assigned, it shall be up to the supervisor to determine whether or not 
the employee should be allowed to remain on standby, taking into account all circumstances 
pertinent to the matter.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees designated by the city manager or department 
head may be provided with 
beepers or cellular telephones so that they may be reached in the event of an emergency. &nbsp;Unless 
such employees are specifically told that they are in on-call status or are instructed as set out in 
subsection (b) above they are not on standby or on-call status and are not entitled to additional 
compensation.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on standby shall 
receive standby compensation of thirteen dollars ($13.00) 
per day except that an employee on standby during the employee's scheduled day off shall 
receive standby compensation of sixteen dollars ($16.00) per day. An employee on standby 
during a recognized city holiday shall receive an additional thirteen dollars ($13.00) for being on 
standby on such a day. </div>
