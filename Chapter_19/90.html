&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent authorized by Chapter 461 RSMo., an employee may designate a beneficiary 
to 
receive pay for work or accrued leaves due the employee upon the employee&#146;s death while still 
employed by the City subject to the following rules:</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must make the beneficiary designation in writing, signed and 
dated by the 
employee, witnessed by an employee designated by the director. &nbsp;The director is authorized to 
create forms for the designation, revocation or change of beneficiary.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee may only designate one beneficiary but may change or revoke that 
designation at any time in writing, witnessed as above.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beneficiary must be a natural person at least eighteen (18) years of age 
at the time of 
the designation.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a beneficiary is disqualified as being too young or shall predecease the 
employee, the 
designation shall be revoked and the final pay check from the city shall be paid to the decedent&#146;s 
estate. &nbsp;If the beneficiary does not survive the employee by more than twenty-four (24) hours, 
the 
beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased the employee.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as set out in these rules, the designation of a beneficiary, including 
the designation 
of a spouse as beneficiary, shall not be automatically terminated or revoked.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount due the beneficiary under this section may be reduced by amounts 
owed the 
city by the employee and any amounts lawfully garnished or owed in taxes, social security or 
otherwise authorized as deductions from pay by the decedent.</span></font></div>
