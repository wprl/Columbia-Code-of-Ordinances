<p class=texthead>Section 19-238 Procedures for grievances and complaints.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;Whenever an employee eligible to file a grievance 
or complaint desires to do so, the 
employee shall follow the procedures set out in this section.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;Employees who feel that they have been discriminated 
against pursuant to equal 
employment opportunity provisions of city ordinance, state or federal laws shall follow the 
complaint procedures set out in section 19-182.</div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee complaining about a job performance review 
may complain directly to the 
employee's department head and if the employee, department head, and supervisor cannot reach 
agreement, the human resources director will attempt to conciliate the matter. If the human 
resources director's recommendation does not resolve the problem, all documentation shall be 
forwarded to the city manager for final determination.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other grievances or complaints must be taken 
to the </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
person who issued the discipline</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
. 
Unresolved grievances or complaints will proceed through the department's chain of command as 
established by the department head.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
Grievances or complaints must be taken to the person who issued the discipline within 
seven (7) working days following knowledge of the occurrence of the problem. If possible, the 
grievance or complaint should be settled at this level through discussions with the involved 
parties. If informal discussions do not resolve the issue, </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
the employee may sign and submit a 
written grievance or complaint </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
to the human resources department within this same seven-day 
time period. The human resources department shall assign the grievance or complaint a number 
for tracking purposes and immediately forward it to the relevant supervisor. The written 
grievance or complaint must describe specific circumstances and state the remedial action 
requested. The person who issued the discipline shall have five (5) working days from receipt of 
the grievance or complaint to respond in writing.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If step (1) does not resolve the situation, the employee may forward the 
grievance or 
complaint to the next supervisory level within five (5) working days following receipt of the 
supervisor's response. Each supervisor shall have five (5) working days to respond in writing 
except that when a grievance or complaint is referred to the department head, the department 
head shall have seven (7) working days to respond.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If step (2) does not satisfactorily resolve the grievance or complaint, the 
employee or 
department head may forward all written documentation concerning the case to the director for 
assistance within five (5) working days following step (2). The director will provide a &nbsp;response 
to the parties involved within seven (7) working days of receipt of the request. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
Organized employee groups may arrange to modify this step, allowing the negotiating teams an 
opportunity to meet and resolve the grievance or complaint. The city's representative would be 
the director, and the duly authorized and recognized employee representative(s) would represent 
the employee(s). If the negotiating teams do not resolve the &nbsp;grievance or complaint, the 
documentation may be forwarded directly to the city manager or in cases of suspensions, 
dismissals, or disciplinary demotions, to the personnel advisory board pursuant to section 19-239.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unresolved grievances or complaints involving 
concerns other than suspensions</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;without 
pay</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
, dismissals, or disciplinary demotions may be filed with the city manager's office within 
seven (7) working days of receipt of the director's response. The city manager shall render a 
decision within fifteen (15) working days, and this decision shall be final and binding.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the expiration of reply deadlines set out 
herein, the human resources director 
may, &nbsp;under reasonable circumstances, grant extensions to such deadlines.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances or complaints which are not specifically 
resolved and not continued by the 
employee within the aforementioned time sequences shall be considered as satisfied and not 
subject to further consideration. Grievance or complaint responses by duly authorized 
management representatives which are contrary to established time sequences shall automatically 
proceed to the next higher authority or step in the grievance/complaint procedure.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
Employees may, at their discretion, </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
give written permission on a form to be provided by 
the human resources department to </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
be represented at any stage of the grievance or complaint 
procedure by representatives of their choosing. </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
A represented employee shall participate fully at 
all stages of the grievance. &nbsp;All documents and other submissions by employee&#146;s representative 
shall be read and signed by the employee to verify that submission is truthful and accurate. 
&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
Employees and their representatives may, with the permission of their supervisors, be granted 
time off with pay for the purpose of necessary discussions and conferences with city supervisors 
and administrators relating to the resolution of specific grievances and complaints.</span><font color=#010101><span
