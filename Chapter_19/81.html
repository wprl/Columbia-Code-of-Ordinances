and equitable pay 
plan which shall consist of the minimum and maximum rates of pay for each classification in the 
classification plan. &nbsp;In arriving at salary rates, consideration will be given to the maintenance 
of 
salary grades of the classifications in the city service in a correct relationship to one another, to 
prevailing rates for comparable work in other public employment and private business, the 
current cost of living, the suggestions of the department head, responsibilities of the position, and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <i>Compensation level for supervisors.</i> Supervisors shall be paid at 
a higher base salary rate 
(excluding overtime and other special considerations) than their subordinates, except as unusual 
circumstances may justify otherwise, with written approval of the director. If, because of 
differences in length of service, a supervisor is paid a rate of pay equal to or lower than one or 
more of </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Compensation of temporary employees.</i> Temporary employees shall be employed within

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <i>Temporary trainee classes.</i> The director, with the approval of the

knowledge and abilities for appointment to a permanent position by the conclusion of the 
individually arranged training program.</span></font></div>

director</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

requirement) of the city manager, be transferred to a limited service status in the same or other 
department. The extent to which the employee is able and needed to perform useful work, as 
determined by the department head and director, shall be the governing factor in determining the 
salary to be paid. An employee on such assignment may utilize appropriate leave accruals in 
conjunction with time worked in order to achieve a full paycheck.</span></font></div>
