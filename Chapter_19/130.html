but may not be used until after 
successful completion of the first thirty (30) days of permanent employment. If an employee 
utilizes sick leave during the first six months of employment, and leaves city service within that 
six months, the employee's final pay will be reduced by the number of sick leave days utilized, 
provided final pay does not fall below minimum wage rate for hours worked.</div>

given an advance of sick leave not 
to exceed twenty (20) working days per calendar year, provided such employee has been a 
satisfactory employee of the city for a period of at least one (1) year. Requests shall be in writing 
and shall offer adequate justification for the request. The advancement shall be authorized by the 
city manager provided the employee has exhausted all eligible leave accruals and there is a 
reasonable chance that the employee will be able to offset the advance by future unused accruals 
of sick, vacation, and other authorized leaves as soon as possible.</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">

plan.</div>

this benefit and abuse shall be just cause for dismissal.</span></div>

entitled to receive separate injury leave in addition to sick leave allocations provided the 
employee is injured while performing assigned duties, as herein provided:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injury leave may be allocated 
in renewable eighty (80) hour (or less) increments at the 
discretion of the city manager (seventy-two (72) hour increments for fire department employees);</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be eligible for injury leave 
provisions, the injury must be fully documented within 
one week of the actual occurrence pursuant to established on-the-job injury reporting 
requirements. Failure to abide by this time deadline shall constitute disqualification from 
eligibility for injury leave allocations;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being eligible for injury 
leave, the employee must submit a timely report of his 
injury to the department head, if reasonably able to do so, and the department head will request 
injury leave allocation by the city manager, provided the department head agrees with the request 
by the employee. Until such time as injury leave may be allocated, the employee will use any 
accrued sick leave, which may or may not be refundable depending upon circumstances 
encountered, as determined by the city manager;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injury leave will be allocated 
(if deemed appropriate by the city manager) only for 
treatment and recuperation for a specific on-the-job injury, and not for incidental ailments which 
may be identified in the course of addressing the job related injury;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injury leave will be immediately 
revoked and repayment required through other accrued 
leaves in the event the employee does not provide medical status information as required by the 
city manager; and injury leave will likewise be revoked in the event the injury is determined to 
have occurred other than on the job;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager shall reserve 
the option to place the injured employee into a limited 
capacity at whatever tasks the city manager deems appropriate, taking into account the extent and 
nature of the disability. The individual's salary will be adjusted commensurate with the work 
being performed, and the difference in salary may be made up (if the assignment is lower paid) 
with injury leave so long as the city manager deems appropriate, at his discretion;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any reasonable suspicion of misuse 
of injury leave or questions concerning the 
authenticity of the injury's extent or occurrence, shall be cause for discontinuing the injury (or 
any other) leave, requiring repayment for any injury days allocated, and shall also be cause for 
disciplinary action up to and including dismissal;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee becomes eligible 
for disability retirement, any and all injury days or 
accrued sick leave days shall be cancelled;</div>

) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave buy back:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Eligibility.</i> A permanent employee who, at the end of a fiscal year, has accumulated 
unused sick leave equal to or in excess of the regular hours the employee normally works in a 
twenty-six week period (for example, one thousand forty (1,040) hours for an employee on a 
forty-hour workweek) shall be eligible to participate in the city's sick leave buy back program for 
the following fiscal year. To be eligible a person must still be employed by the city on the first 
day of the new fiscal year.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Buy back provisions.</i> The city, upon the written request of an eligible employee, shall 
buy back up to one hundred (100) percent of the total unused sick leave accumulated by the 
employee during the preceding fiscal year which is in excess of the minimum required for 
eligibility. For each hour of sick leave bought back by the city, the employee shall receive fifty 
(50) percent of his hourly rate of pay in effect at the time that the sick leave buy back check is 
written or, in the case of a former employee, the former employee's final rate of pay. The 
employee's total accumulated sick leave time will be reduced by the number of hours of sick 
leave sold back to the city.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Procedure.</i> The deadline for eligible employees to make written requests for sick leave 
buy back is November 15 of each year, unless extended by the city manager. Employees shall be 
given at least four (4) weeks' notice of the deadline and the proper procedure for requesting sick 
leave buy back. For good cause, the city manager may allow an employee to make a late request 
for sick leave buy back.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Police and firefighters' injury leave.</i> For purposes of calculating the amount of sick leave 
which the city will buy back, the total unused sick leave accumulated by an employee during the 
preceding fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of any injury leave granted to the employee 
by the city manager during the preceding fiscal year pursuant to subsection (p) of this section. 
This provision reduces the amount of sick leave which the city will buy back from an employee. 
It does not reduce the employee's accumulated sick leave.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Major illness.</i> An employee who has participated in this program and who subsequently 
uses all of the employee's accumulated sick leave may be granted, at the employee's request, 
additional leave at one-half ( 1/2) of the employee's normal rate of pay, up to the number of hours 
sold back to the city between October 1, 1988 and September 30, 2000, and at </span><font color=#010101><span 
style="font-size:11pt">
three-fourths (3/4) 
</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
of the employee's normal rate of pay on the number of hours sold back to the city </span><font color=#010101><span

between

October 1, 2000 </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
and September 30, 2009 and at one-half (1/2) of the employee's normal rate of 
pay on the number of hours sold back to the city after October 1, 2009.</span></font></div>
