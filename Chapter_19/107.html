<p class=texthead>Section 19-107 Uniform clothing allowance.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Employees required to wear uniform clothing, specifically 
those individuals readily visible 
to the general public, will be provided with such clothing allocations as deemed appropriate by 
the department head. If allocations are provided, the employee shall be required to wear the 
uniform clothing, to maintain the garments in a clean and maintained fashion, and to return the 
full allocation of garments upon separation from city service (or be docked the fair value of 
missing articles from the final paycheck). The city shall replace uniform clothing damaged 
through natural wear on the job, but not due to negligence by the employee. The employee shall 
wear uniform clothing only en route to and from work and while on duty, and police and fire 
personnel shall be subject to specific departmental policies concerning clothing allotments and/or 
allowances. Uniformed police officers will have uniforms dry cleaned at city expense within 
limits of the annual department budget allocation for such purpose. Upon the expiration of 
available funds, the individual employee will be responsible for dry cleaning of the uniforms. 
Rules and procedures for dry cleaning of uniforms by the city may be established by the police 
chief, and when established must be followed by the employee. Commissioned police assigned to 
plain clothes operations, as specified and defined by the police chief, working a forty-hour week, 
shall receive additional compensation not to exceed forty-four cents ($0.44) per hour, to be added 
to their regular rate of pay, for obtaining necessary clothing. </div>
