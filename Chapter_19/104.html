&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <i>Tools.</i> Department heads may at their discretion (provided funds are 
budgeted for this 
purpose) establish departmental policies providing and/or replacing professional tools of a trade 
used specifically for city operations, depending on the need of the operations in the best interest 
of efficient, effective work.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <i>Personal protective gear.</i> Department heads may at their discretion 
require that employees 
wear safety boots and glasses which meet departmental safety standards (as defined by the 
department head and coordinated with the director). When additional protective footwear is 
required of current employees, the department head may aid in securing appropriate and 
approved safety boots or shoes by reimbursing the employee for the safety-portion cost of the 
footwear up to a maximum of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per individual per year. &nbsp;Department 
heads may likewise establish policies concerning needed eye protection, and allowing up to a 
maximum of fifty dollars ($50.00) per person per year for safety glasses (plainos, tinted, 
peripheral protection, or safety prescription lenses). The city will allow eligible employees to 
have a four-year accumulation of the safety shoe allowance.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <i>Reimbursement for personal protective equipment.</i> Reimbursement for 
personal protective 
equipment shall be contingent upon appropriate budgetary allocations; and once current 
employees are equipped as needed, department heads may elect to require such equipment as a 
condition of employment depending on the needs of their respective operations.</span></font></div>
