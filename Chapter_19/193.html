&nbsp;opinion, such employee is unable or unwilling to perform 
the duties of the position satisfactorily or the employee's attitude, habits or dependability do not 
merit continuation in the service. An employee removed during the probationary or qualifying 
period cannot appeal such removal to the personnel advisory board. Employees promoted </span><font color=#010101><span

established by the city manager as a temporary position. If such a position is not available, the 
employee may be placed on priority reemployment or transfer certification lists for
