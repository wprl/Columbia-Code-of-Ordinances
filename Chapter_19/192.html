<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Every person transferred, demoted, promoted, appointed 
or reappointed to a permanent 
position with the city shall be required to complete a successful probationary or qualifying period 
of at least six (6) continuous months duration.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Individuals placed in entry-level police officer, fire-fighter, 
airport safety officer or 
emergency telecommunicator positions are required to complete a successful probationary or 
qualifying period of at least eighteen (18) continuous months. All other commissioned police and 
fire positions will serve a twelve-month probationary or qualifying period. Positions identified as 
ineligible for overtime in the city's pay plan, are required to complete a successful probationary 
or qualifying period of at least twelve (12) continuous months; other positions shall serve a six-month 
probationary or qualifying period.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The probationary or qualifying period shall begin immediately 
upon appointment to a 
permanent position. The probation or qualifying time period may be extended if deemed 
necessary by the department head. Such an extension must be processed as a personnel 
requisition, with review by the director.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Time spent in an &quot;acting&quot; capacity prior to 
receiving a permanent appointment to the same 
classification and department shall be considered as time spent as a probationary or qualifying 
employee in the position.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) An employee who is promoted or transferred prior to completing 
a probationary period 
shall begin a new probationary (not qualifying) period in the new position, and shall have no 
grievance/appeal privileges until a probationary period is successfully completed in one 
classification. The employee shall, however, be eligible for benefits specified in these policies 
(or prorated equivalent thereof if in a permanent part-time position).</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) An employee whose position is reclassified will not be 
required to complete a new 
probationary or qualifying period. An employee whose position is reclassified prior to 
completing a probationary period will not complete a new probationary period, but shall be 
required to successfully complete the original probationary period.</div>
