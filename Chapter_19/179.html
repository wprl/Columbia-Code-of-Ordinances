<p class=texthead>Section 19-179 Recruitment.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) EEO affirmative action will consist of active recruitment 
of female, disadvantaged, 
underemployed, and/or minority candidates for positions within the city at all levels.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Active recruitment will mean:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First consideration for filling 
all vacancies in a department shall be given to qualified 
employees of lower rank within the same department or qualified employees from other 
departments.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of agencies and 
programs concerned with educational and employment 
opportunities for female and/or minority members.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to contact 
a variety of agencies and individuals to identify 
prospective applicants, and notification will be made to such agencies of all new positions and 
the requirements of each as soon as each position becomes available.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All vacancies and new positions 
in city departments or agencies, not initially filled by a 
present city employee, shall be publicly advertised; and the statement &quot;The City of Columbia is 
a 
merit, affirmative action, equal opportunity employer: Male/Female.&quot; shall be included wherever 
practicable in employment advertisements.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The director will place employment advertising in publications 
with a broad circulation so 
that a potentially large number of female and minority groups can be reached.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Systematic contact will be kept with the local state 
employment security commission office 
and community action agencies to encourage referral of applicants for positions.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Present employees are encouraged to refer female or minority 
applicants when positions 
are available.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The city will aggressively seek more female and minority 
candidates in classifications in 
which females and minorities are identified as underutilized by making it known to all 
recruitment sources that female and minority members are being sought for consideration when 
positions are available.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) The director will continually review the employment situation 
to determine if:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are any job categories which, 
in practical effect, are closed to female and minority 
groups;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring practices indicate that 
all applicants are considered solely on the basis of their 
qualifications for the job openings for which they have applied;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial job in which a new 
employee is placed is determined or materially influenced 
by whether or not he/she is a member of a minority group;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimal entry qualifications are 
in fact necessary, valid, and justifiable in terms of 
acceptable and required performance levels;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>and if problems exist in any of these areas, the director shall take the necessary 
actions to correct 
inequities.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) The director will establish a system through which it 
is possible to verify the number of 
minority applicants and the number of minority workers newly employed or promoted in 
reference to the number of applications received, openings available, and salaries earned.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) All qualifications for employment shall be fully job-related. 
Any tests given by the city, 
once reliably and validly established, will be equitable and identical for all applicants for a given 
position. Continuous review of the tests shall be conducted by the director to ensure their 
validity.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) The qualifications of all employees, including females 
and/or those of minority 
background, will be reviewed regularly to ensure that qualified, interested individuals are 
considered for promotion and upgrading.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) As many female and minority and/or disadvantaged trainees 
and summer part-time 
employees will be used as work needs justify and expenditures allow and shall be on a 
representative relationship to the general community as much as possible.</div>
