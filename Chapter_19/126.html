<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Employees on jury duty shall be paid by the employer 
in an amount equal to the difference 
between the amount of wages the employee would have earned by working during straight-time 
hours for the employer on that day and the daily jury duty fee paid by the courts (not including 
traveling expenses or reimbursement of expenses), for each day on which the employee 
otherwise would have been scheduled for work.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) An employee shall not have deductions made from accrued 
leaves for the purpose of these 
provisions.</div>

Employees (except those testifying in the line of duty</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;or testifying in a case in which they 
are a party</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
) shall be granted leave with pay when required to be absent to serve as a court witness 
and shall be paid in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of wages the
