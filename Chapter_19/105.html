<p class=texthead>Section 19-105 Employee development--Generally.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In order to be eligible for development incentive programs 
an employee must be eligible 
for the city's full benefit package pursuant to this chapter and be a permanent full-time employee 
in a regularly budgeted position, having completed at least one full year of service and a 
probationary period successfully. An employee's total performance record shall be considered in 
determinations of eligibility and desirability for participating in these incentive programs.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Individual departments may establish, with the aid of 
the human resources department, 
employee development programs in terms of specific needs of their operations. These 
development programs may consist of in-service training, seminars, short courses, lectures, 
reading materials, formal course work, films, tapes and so forth. Funds for programs shall be 
appropriated in the departmental budget, and remain effective within the limit of allocation of 
funds for this purpose. Implementation of development programs shall be within the purview of 
the EEO affirmative action program.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The purpose of employee development programs is to promote 
professionalism in all areas 
of city employment with the ultimate goal of upgrading the working scope, ability, and total 
effectiveness of city employees, thereby improving productivity, efficiency, and economy of 
operations. Such training programs shall be considered as a benefit to those individuals interested 
in continued employment with the city; and approval of an individual's participation shall be 
relative to the employee's present or probable future city position and relative worth of such 
activity to the city organization (as determined by the department head and the director).</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Where applicable (police and fire operations specifically) 
educational incentive and tuition 
reimbursement programs shall be considered as temporary, interim steps toward a more valid 
proficiency evaluation of relative worth of employee services. Once the desired, increased 
capability and educational level of current employees has been developed, new employees will 
be placed requiring the same higher level of competence, thereby perpetuating quality service 
and eventually phasing out of formalized incentive education/training oriented programs.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Employees may be allowed time off from work to attend 
approved formal classes or 
training sessions; provided, the employee makes up the hours in full, on the job, in a meaningful, 
responsible work assignment; and such absence does not impose additional expense to the 
department in terms of overtime pay or burden on other employees, as determined by the 
department head.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Attendance at training sessions of any type shall be 
on the employee's own time unless such 
attendance is required by the department head, and under no circumstances shall class/training 
time and associated travel time be considered as time on the job for overtime eligibility or extra 
pay unless specifically designated so eligible by the department head. Participation in 
development programs shall be considered a mutually rewarding situation, with an employee's 
commitment of interest, job dedication, and personal sacrifice being inherent, required elements 
for eligibility to participate.</div>
