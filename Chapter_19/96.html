department head, not be held rigidly to the established city

<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city does not make deductions

overtime </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">

because of variations in the quality or quantity of work performed. Rather, unsatisfactory 
quantities or quality of work are addressed through regular performance management methods
