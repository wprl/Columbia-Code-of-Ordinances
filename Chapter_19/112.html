available additional fringe benefits to unclassified employees on an individual basis, which may 
include additional leave accrual and limits, increased insurance coverage, deferred compensation 
allowance, severance pay, vehicle allowance and similar fringe benefit considerations as are 
appropriate in the individual circumstances. The city manager shall notify the city council of 
such fringe benefits. The benefits shall take effect after the next regular council meeting, unless
