within five (5) working days of receipt of the director's 
response may file a written request with the human resources departmentfor a hearing before the 
personnel advisory board. Such request shall set forth in substance the employee's grievance and 
reasons for appeal of action taken thereon. Such hearing shall be scheduled as soon as possible 
and shall be conducted by procedures and rules established by the personnel advisory board. The 
employee(s) filing the grievance shall have the option of having the hearing open or closed, and 
shall indicate an open or closed meeting upon filing a request for a hearing. If the employee 
changes his/her mind concerning opening or closing a hearing, such a request shall be made to 
the board which will make a determination in the matter. The employee shall have the right to be 
heard and to present evidence. Testimony shall be given under oath and a record made of the 
hearing. </div>

shall upon 
request of any party issue subpoenas and shall in a proper case issue subpoenas duces tecum for 
the hearing, but not for depositions. Subpoenas shall be issued, served and enforced in the same 
manner as subpoenas issued under Chapter 536 RSMo. by agencies created by the constitution or 
state statute. Technical rules of evidence shall not apply. After hearing and consideration of the 
evidence and within ten (10) working days after the hearing, the board shall render its 
recommendations in writing to the city manager. As soon as possible after the hearing, a certified 
written transcript of the hearing along with all exhibits produced at the hearing shall be delivered 
to the city manager. The city manager shall review the transcript and exhibits and, within thirty 
(30) days of receiving the transcript, render a decision supported by findings of fact and 
conclusions of law which shall be final, binding and not subject to further administrative appeal.</div>

working days, and this decision shall be final and binding. </div>
