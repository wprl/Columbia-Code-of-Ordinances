<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A leave of absence without pay is a predetermined amount of time off from 
work, which 
has been requested by the employee, recommended by the employee's department head and 
approved by the director. Such leave shall not extend beyond six (6) months, but may be 
extended with the written approval of the department head.</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
<b> &nbsp;</b>An employee must use all 
accumulated eligible leave accruals before beginning a leave of absence.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The fact that such a leave is possible does not mean that the requested 
leave must be 
granted. A leave of absence deprives the employee's department of the services of an employee, 
who it is assumed is needed if the department is to properly perform its services. Leaves of 
absence without pay, except in the case of disciplinary leaves, should be considered as a 
privilege, and the best interests of city service must be the determining factors in whether such 
leaves are granted or not.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) When an employee is granted a leave of absence without pay, the department 
head makes a 
commitment to allow the employee to return to work at the end of the leave to a position for 
which the employee is fully qualified at the prevailing salary for the position, provided there is a 
vacancy. If no vacancy exists in the department, the individual may be placed on eligibility 
rosters pursuant to the person's qualifications and as approved by the director.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mandatory leave of absence occurs after a employee files a declaration 
of candidacy 
and the leave ends when the results of the election are certified. In the case of a mandatory leave 
of absence, an employee shall use all accumulated eligible leave accruals and then shall be 
placed on unpaid leave of absence status and follow the requirements of subsections (e), (f) and 
(g) of this section. The department head shall allow the employee to return to work at the end of 
the leave of absence to a position for which the employee is fully qualified.</span></div>
