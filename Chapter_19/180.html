<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female and minority employees as well as others will be encouraged 
to increase their skills 
and job potential through participation in training and education programs, and the city will 
regularly review and help to assure that such programs, when established or provided, are 
available to employees on an equal opportunity basis. The city will seek to have female and 
minority employees take advantage of training opportunities in numbers that are representative 
when compared to the size of the work force, and when training is available generally to other 
employees in the same classification within the parameters of departmental operations and an 
individual's capability to benefit from various types and degrees of training which may in some 
cases be significantly advanced and/or cumulative in nature.</div>
