<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It is the policy of the city to promote and ensure equal opportunity for 
all persons (without 
regard to race, creed, color, marital status, national origin, religion, sex, age, sexual 
orientation,</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;gender identity,</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">

disability,</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;political affiliation or ancestry) employed or seeking 
employment, using city facilities or being serviced by the city. The policy of equality applies to 
every aspect of city employment practice and policy involving all activity areas.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The city assures non-discrimination in recruiting, hiring, training, placement, 
advancement, 
compensation, working conditions, demotion, layoff and termination.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It is, in addition, the policy of the city to assert leadership within the 
community and to put 
forth the maximum effort to achieve non-discriminatory, equal employment opportunities 
throughout the political jurisdiction of the city. Affirmative action will be taken to make known 
that equal employment opportunities are available on the basis of the merits of the individual and 
consistent with the city's goals and timetables for staffing in terms of female and minority 
representation on the city's work force: striving for a work force in each occupation which 
corresponds to the actual availability of qualified females and minorities for that job in their 
respective recruitment area.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Department heads and supervisors are responsible for implementation of this 
policy and 
the affirmative action program within their responsibility areas. All applicants and employees 
shall be expected to be qualified for the position they are seeking, and to indicate through 
performance, capability of at least acceptably performing assigned duties. Encouragement, 
information and appropriate on-the-job orientation and training are to be provided to all new 
employees to assist them in performing their job assignments effectively.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Job placements shall be made by the city manager as delegated to respective 
department 
heads. The appointing authorities (director and department heads) shall encourage, and take 
appropriate affirmative action from the time of job requisition to hiring decision in all job 
positions to achieve and maintain EEO objectives and goals as rapidly as possible.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) While EEO affirmative action shall be considered a top priority, neither 
shall it 
unreasonably infringe upon the goal of efficient, productive, continuing public service.</span></font></div>
