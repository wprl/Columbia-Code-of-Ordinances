<p class=texthead>Section 28-83 Inspection.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicle permits shall only be granted after an inspection 
as set out in this section. In addition 
to all other vehicle inspections required by law, each vehicle governed by this article shall be 
subject to an annual inspection. All inspections shall be conducted by persons designated by the 
city manager and shall consist of the following:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All taxicabs and limousines shall 
be inspected for proper markings, display of 
information, and the following:</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Exterior.</i> Headlights, taillights, brake lights, directional signal lights, license plate 
lights, windshield, vent glasses, windshield wipers, all other vehicle glass, glass window raisers, 
doors and door locks, trunk lid, trunk hood, and interior door handles, exhaust system, splash 
shields, hubcaps, bumpers, fenders, body and tires shall be inspected to ascertain that each is 
functioning properly. Each taxicab shall be maintained in a reasonably clean condition. There 
shall be no tears or rust holes in the vehicle body and no loose pieces such as fenders, bumpers or 
trim hanging from the vehicle body. There shall be no unrepaired body damage which would 
create a safety problem or interfere with the operation of the vehicle.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Interior.</i> The rear view mirror, steering wheel, foot brakes, parking brakes, seat belts 
and air conditioning and heating systems shall be inspected to ascertain that each is functioning 
properly. The upholstery, floor mats, head lining, door panels and the trunk compartment shall be 
inspected to determine whether they are clean, free of tears, and that the trunk has sufficient 
space for passengers' luggage. The taximeter shall be inspected to determine that it is properly 
calibrated.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to have a vehicle inspected 
as required herein shall be a ground for suspension of 
the vehicle permit. If a vehicle for hire fails to pass the requirements of inspection, a correction 
slip shall be issued to the driver, listing the items that need correction and showing the status of 
the inspection. The vehicle shall not be operated as a vehicle for hire until it successfully passes 
inspection; provided, that the business license administrator, in his discretion, for a period not to 
exceed fifteen (15) days, may allow the continued use of a vehicle for hire which substantially 
complies with the inspection requirements. The business license administrator shall forward to 
the permit holder a copy of the correction slip.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall prohibit 
the random inspection of vehicles for hire by the business 
license administrator or police department where possible violations of this article or other 
violations of law regarding the condition of vehicles for hire are evidence by visual inspection.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denial or suspension of a vehicle 
permit may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of 
section 13-31 of the City Code.</div>
<br>
