<p class=texthead>Section 28-31 Computation of license tax.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon an application for a license by a person who has been 
engaged in the business sought to 
be licensed in the city for a period of at least one year next before the date of his application, the 
license tax of such person shall be computed from the license schedule applicable to such 
business, and, if necessary, the amount of license tax shall be determined from an affidavit made 
by the applicant on forms prescribed by the business license administrator, indicating the bracket 
of the license schedule applicable to such business in which the gross sales within the city for 
such person fell for the preceding fiscal or annual business year of such business. If the applicant 
shall not have been engaged, within the city, for at least one year next before his application, the 
amount of the license tax shall be computed based upon a declaration of the estimate of gross 
sales, to be made upon forms prescribed by the business license administrator, and sworn to 
before a notary public, which declaration of estimate shall indicate, where applicable, the bracket 
in which the applicant's estimate of gross sales within the city for the ensuing licensing year will 
fall.</div>
