<p class=texthead>Section 28-81 Investigation; granting of application.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Upon the filing of an application, the business license 
administrator shall cause an 
investigation into the facts stated upon the application. The application shall be approved and a 
permit to operate granted unless the investigation reveals good cause to believe that the public 
welfare or safety would be adversely affected if the permit were granted.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Grounds to deny a permit to operate shall include, but 
not limited to, the following:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever an applicant files an 
incomplete application.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever an applicant makes a 
false declaration on the application.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any person required to 
be listed upon the application has had a permit issued 
under this article revoked within the past two (2) years.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever an applicant has outstanding 
judgments against him for damages resulting 
from the negligent operation of a vehicle.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the applicant fails to 
have a current City of Columbia business permit or has 
not applied for a City of Columbia business permit concurrent with his application for a taxicab 
or limousine permit.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants have the burden of 
demonstrating good moral character. &nbsp;If an applicant has 
been convicted of a felony within the past ten (10) years or any misdemeanor involving theft or 
the sale of or possession of illegal drugs or sexual abuse within the past five (5) years or any 
municipal ordinance violation of leaving the scene of an accident or failure to report an accident 
or any violation of this article, the business license administrator may deny the license after 
considering the nature of the crime or ordinance violation committed in relation to the license 
sought, the conduct of the applicant since the violation, and other evidence as to the applicant&#146;s 
character.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Denial of a license by the business license administrator 
may be appealed pursuant to the 
provisions of section 13-31 of the City Code.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) An applicant who has been denied a permit to operate 
shall not reapply for a permit to 
operate for a period of one year following the denial.</div>
