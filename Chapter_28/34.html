<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The license tax required on each motor bus shall be a tax 
on the business of conveying 
passengers over and upon the public streets and places in the city. Nothing herein contained shall 
be construed as to exempt the owner from the paying of the tax imposed as a registration tax or 
license by the city in licensing motor vehicles or automobiles to be operated on its streets, or the 
tax which the city levies on motor vehicles or automobiles as personal property. Nor shall 
anything herein be construed to exempt the owner or driver of a motor vehicle from the 
qualifications which the city or the state may require of persons who operate motor vehicles or 
automobiles upon public streets.</div>
