<p class=texthead>Section 28-97 Additional passengers in taxicabs.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) When a driver is transporting a passenger, no other person 
shall be received by the driver 
into such taxicab until the destination is reached without the consent of such passenger. No 
charge shall be made for any additional passenger except when the passenger rides beyond the 
previous passenger's destination, and then only for the additional distance traveled, except for the 
charge for an extra passenger as posted in the schedule of rates.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In cases where more than one passenger enters a taxicab 
at the same time, bound for 
different destinations, the fare shall be charged as follows: When a passenger reaches his 
destination and pays his fare, the meter shall be reset. When a passenger reaches his destination 
and does not pay the fare or any part of the fare, then the fare or any part of the fare not paid by 
the passenger shall be paid by the last passenger to reach his destination. However, the last 
passenger so delivered shall not be liable to pay more than the rate that he would have been 
obligated to pay if he were the only passenger from point of being taken on as a passenger to his 
point of destination.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Any person operating a taxicab in violation of this section 
shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor.</div>
