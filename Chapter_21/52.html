<p class=texthead>Section 21-52 Board review and recommendation.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board shall review the record 
of the investigation and may request the police chief to 
order further investigation. &nbsp;Subject to the availability of appropriated funds, the city shall 
contract with independent investigators &nbsp;to assist the board in its investigations of alleged police 
misconduct.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board, as part of the review 
of an appeal, may interview and hear comments from 
witnesses to the incident under investigation. &nbsp;The board shall not allow comments by the general 
public as part of the review. &nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police chief and all police officers 
shall cooperate with the board in its review of 
appeals from the police chief&#146;s decision. &nbsp;Cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, 
appearing before the board upon request and answering all questions honestly and thoroughly. 
Failure to cooperate shall be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board shall provide timely updates 
on the progress of the review and any follow-up 
investigation to the complainant and the police officer, unless the specific facts of the review and 
investigation would prohibit such updates.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board may decline further action 
on an appeal if it determines that the alleged acts of 
misconduct are false and that the complainant knew they were false when the appeal was filed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing its review and investigation, 
the board shall report its findings and 
recommendations to the city manager, the police chief, the police officer and the complainant. &nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the board agrees with the police 
chief&#146;s disposition of the complaint, it shall give 
notice to the police officer and the complainant that they have the right to appeal the chief&#146;s 
decision as provided in section 21-53.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the board recommends a disposition 
of the complaint other than the disposition made 
by the police chief, the chief shall have ten (10) business days to reconsider the original decision 
and either reaffirm or modify it. &nbsp;The chief shall give written notice of the decision to the board, 
the city manager, the police officer and the complainant. &nbsp;The police chief shall also give notice 
to the police officer and the complainant that they have the right to appeal the chief&#146;s decision 
as 
provided for in section 21-53. &nbsp;If the chief takes no action within ten (10) business days after 
the 
date of the board&#146;s findings and recommendation, the original decision is automatically 
reaffirmed and the board shall give notice to the police officer and the complainant that they have 
the right to appeal the chief&#146;s decision as provided for in section 21-53. </div>
