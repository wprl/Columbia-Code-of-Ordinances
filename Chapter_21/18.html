<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, in the opinion of the chief of police, the regular 
police force of the city, provided for by 
ordinance, shall be insufficient to deal with any emergency or to enforce the ordinances of the 
city and the laws of the state within the city, the chief of police may, with the approval of the city 
manager, commission special temporary police officers, who shall possess the legal requirements 
for police officers, with or without compensation, and for such period as he may determine; 
provided, that no temporary police officer shall be appointed for a longer period than one year. 
Such appointment shall be reported to the city manager and, when approved by him, the city 
clerk shall issue to each special temporary police officer a commission which shall set forth the 
day and hour of the appointment and the day and hour of the expiration thereof. Such special 
temporary police officers shall have all the powers and duties of the regular police officers of the 
city as established by ordinances and by the laws of the state, and like responsibilities. Any or all 
appointments of special temporary police officers may be revoked by the chief of police by 
giving notice of such revocation to the city clerk.</div>
