<p class=texthead>Section 21-53 Appeals to city manager or personnel advisory board.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>After the board&#146;s findings and recommendation or, if applicable, the chief&#146;s 
decision after 
reconsideration, the police officer and the complainant shall have the right to appeal as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer may appeal the 
police chief&#146;s decision to the personnel advisory board 
if the officer was suspended, demoted or discharged. &nbsp;The appeal shall be made by filing a 
written request with the city clerk for a hearing before the personnel advisory board. &nbsp;The request 
shall set forth the employee&#146;s grievance and reasons for appeal. &nbsp;The request must be filed 
within 
twenty-one (21) days after the officer was given notice of the right to appeal. &nbsp;The hearing shall 
be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 19. &nbsp;The director of human resources shall 
give the complainant ten (10) days written notice of the hearing. &nbsp;At the hearing, the complainant 
shall be allowed to testify to the facts of the incident and shall be allowed to express an opinion 
on the appropriate personnel advisory board action.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police officer may appeal the 
police chief&#146;s decision to the city manager if the 
officer&#146;s discipline was other than suspension, demotion or discharge. &nbsp;The appeal shall be 
made 
by filing a written statement with the city manager setting forth the employee&#146;s reasons for 
appeal. &nbsp;The request must be filed within twenty-one (21) days after the officer was given notice 
of the right to appeal. &nbsp;The appeal shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of chapter 
19. &nbsp;The city manager shall give notice of the appeal to the complainant and afford the 
complainant the opportunity to discuss the matter with the city manager.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complainant may appeal the 
police chief&#146;s decision to the city manager. &nbsp;The appeal 
shall be made by filing a written statement with the city manager explaining the reasons for the 
appeal. &nbsp;The request must be filed within twenty-one (21) days after the complainant was given 
notice of the right to appeal. &nbsp;The city manager shall give notice of the appeal to the police 
officer. &nbsp;The officer shall have fourteen (14) days after notice has been given to file a written 
response to the complainant&#146;s appeal with the city manager. &nbsp;The officer and the complainant 
shall not otherwise communicate with the city manager concerning the complaint. &nbsp;If the 
employee has also appealed, the procedures of subsection (a) or (b) shall be followed. &nbsp;If the 
employee has not appealed, and the city manager determines that the alleged facts may merit 
more severe discipline involving the suspension, demotion or discharge of the police officer, the 
city manager may refer the matter to the personnel advisory board for a hearing following the 
procedures set forth in chapter 19. &nbsp;Otherwise, the city manager may act on the appeal as the 
manager deems appropriate.</div>
