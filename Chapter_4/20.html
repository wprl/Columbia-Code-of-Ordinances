<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this section 
pertaining to possession of intoxicating liquor and 
nonintoxicating beer shall not apply to a student who:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is eighteen (18) years of age

(3) of this subsection only for instructional purposes 
during classes that are part of the curriculum of the accredited college or university.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>The beverage must at all times remain in the possession and control of an authorized 
instructor of 
the college or university, who must be twenty-one (21) years of age or older. &nbsp;Nothing in this 
subsection may be construed to allow a student under the age of twenty-one (21) to receive any 
beer, ale, porter, wine, or other similar malt or fermented beverage unless the beverage is 
delivered as part of the student&#146;s required curriculum and the beverage is used only for 
instructional purposes during classes conducted as part of the curriculum.</div>

&nbsp;reaching the age of twenty-one (21) a person 
who has pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty of violating this section for the first time, and 
who since such conviction has not been convicted of any other alcohol-related offense and who 
is not on probation for the violation of this section at the time application is made, may apply to 
the court in which the person was sentenced for an order to expunge all official records of the 
arrest, plea, trial and conviction except the municipal prosecutor's records. </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
No records shall be 
expunged if the person who has pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty of violating this 
section is licensed as a commercial motor vehicle driver or was operating a commercial motor 
vehicle as defined in &#167; 302.700, RSMo, at the time of the violation. &nbsp;</span><font color=#010101><span 
style="font-size:11pt">
If the court determines, upon 
review, that such person has not been convicted of any other alcohol-related offense at the time 
of the application for expungement, and the person has had no other alcohol-related enforcement 
contacts, as defined in RSMo &#167; 302.525, the court shall enter an order of expungement. The 
effect of such an order shall be to restore such person to the status the person occupied prior to 
such arrest, plea or conviction, as if such event had never happened. No person as to whom such 
order has been entered shall be held thereafter under any provision of any law to be guilty of 
perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of the person's failure to recite or 
acknowledge such arrest, plea, trial, conviction or expungement in response to any inquiry made 
of the person for any purpose whatsoever. A person shall be entitled to only one expungement 
pursuant to this section. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the municipal court or 
other city officials from maintaining such records as are necessary to ensure that an individual 
receives only one expungement pursuant to this section.</span></font></div>
