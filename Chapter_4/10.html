The director of finance, after receiving an appeal from a license denial, shall schedule a 
meeting of the liquor license review board. &nbsp;Before the meeting, the board members shall be 
provided with copies of the letter of denial, the notice of appeal and any documentation and 
position statements provided by the business services administrator and the applicant pertaining 
to the license denial. &nbsp;The board may allow the business services administrator and the applicant 
or the applicant&#146;s representative to explain their positions to the board at the meeting. &nbsp;The 
board 
may either affirm the denial of the license or direct the business services administrator to grant 
the license. &nbsp;The license, in the board&#146;s discretion, may be for less than the full period 
of time 
ending on June 30. &nbsp;In that case, the licensee shall pay only a prorated license fee. If the board 
affirms the denial, it shall set forth the grounds for denial in a letter to the applicant. &nbsp;The 
letter 
shall be hand delivered or sent by first class mail. &nbsp;A mailed letter shall be presumed received 
three (3) days after it was mailed.</span></div>
