<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denial. &nbsp;When a license under 
this chapter is denied, the business services administrator 
shall send a letter to the applicant stating why the license was denied and how to appeal the 
denial. &nbsp;This letter shall be hand delivered or sent by first class mail. &nbsp;A mailed letter 
shall be 
presumed received three (3) days after it was mailed.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal by applicant. &nbsp;The 
applicant may appeal the denial to the liquor license review 
board by mailing or delivering a written notice of appeal to the director of finance and a copy to 
the business services administrator. &nbsp;The notice of appeal must be received by the director no 
later than ten (10) days after the applicant received the letter of denial. &nbsp;The applicant may 
submit to the director of finance a position statement explaining why applicant believes the 
license should be granted. &nbsp;The business services administrator may also submit to the director 
a 
position statement explaining why the administrator believes the denial should be upheld.</div>
<br>
<div align=left><span style="font-size:11pt">
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to continue operation. &nbsp;If an application 
for renewal of a license is denied, an 
applicant who has filed an appeal under this section shall be allowed to continue operating as 
though the license were renewed until the liquor license review board has rendered a decision. &nbsp;If 
the board affirms the denial of the license, the applicant shall be allowed to continue operating as 
though the license were renewed until ten (10) days after receiving the letter of denial. &nbsp;If an 
appeal is taken to Circuit Court, the Court may allow the applicant to continue operation as 
though the license were renewed.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal by neighbor. &nbsp;Any 
person residing, owning property or maintaining a place of 
business within 600 feet of property upon which a licensed establishment is located may send a 
letter to the business services administrator objecting to the renewal of a liquor license. &nbsp;The 
letter shall state the grounds for the objection. &nbsp;After renewing or denying the license, the 
business services administrator shall promptly notify the objecting neighbor, by first class mail, 
of the action taken on the application. &nbsp;The notice shall be presumed received three (3) days after 
it was mailed. &nbsp;If the license is renewed, the objecting neighbor may appeal the renewal to the 
liquor license review board by mailing or delivering a written notice of appeal to the director of 
finance and mailing or delivering copies to the business services administrator and to the 
licensee. &nbsp;The notice of appeal must be received by the director no later than ten (10) days after 
the objecting neighbor received the notice that the license was renewed. &nbsp;The objecting neighbor 
may submit to the director of finance a position statement explaining why the objecting neighbor 
believes the license should not be renewed. &nbsp;The licensee and the business services administrator 
may also submit position statements to the director.</div>
