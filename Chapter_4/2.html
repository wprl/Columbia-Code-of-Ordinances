<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be unlawful for any person, 
either personally or through the use of agents or 
employees, to engage in the manufacture, brewing, sale or distribution of intoxicating liquors or 
nonintoxicating beer within the city, without the appropriate license issued under this chapter. 
Licenses shall be issued for a period of one year from the thirtieth (30th) day of June each year. 
Persons desiring to secure licenses after the thirtieth (30th) day of June shall pay for such portion 
of the license year remaining at the time such license is issued. Thereafter, all renewals of 
licenses shall be made on the thirtieth (30th) day of June each year. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the business services administrator 
determines that there is good reason not to issue a 
license for the full period of time ending on June 30, the business services administrator may 
issue a license for a shorter period of time. &nbsp;Persons licensed under this subsection shall pay 
only 
a prorated license fee.</div>
