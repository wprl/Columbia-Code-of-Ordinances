&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prosecutions under this chapter, there is a rebuttable presumption that a 
container marked or 
labeled as containing an alcoholic beverage actually contains the described alcoholic beverage. 
This rebuttable presumption applies to both open and sealed containers. This rebuttable 
presumption applies only in cases where a sample of the contents of the container has been 
preserved and is available to the defendant for testing. </span></font></div>
