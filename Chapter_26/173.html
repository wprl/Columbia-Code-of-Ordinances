<p>
<body>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the duty of the person issued a building permit 
to apply for an amended building 
permit if the total floor area of new construction of a structure exceeds the amount stated in the 
building permit application. The application for an amended building permit shall be made prior 
to final inspection. If a building permit is amended to increase the total floor area of new 
construction, an additional stormwater development charge shall be paid for the increased area. 
The additional stormwater development charge shall be paid at or before the time the certificate 
of occupancy is issued. If a building permit is amended to decrease the total floor area of new 
construction, a proportionate refund of the stormwater development charge paid shall be made to 
the person issued the building permit. If the person issued a building permit decides not to build 
the structure, upon application, the stormwater development charge shall be refunded and the 
building permit, if it has not expired, shall be revoked.</div>
