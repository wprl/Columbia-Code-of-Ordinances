shall remain unpaid after the same shall become due and payable, there shall be added to such 
license tax as a penalty, ten (10) per cent of the amount of such license tax for the first month or 
part thereof the same is unpaid, and for each and every month thereafter two (2) per cent of the 
amount of such license tax shall be added until the same is fully paid. If the license tax as

permit inspection of his books and records upon request, or who files a false or fraudulent
