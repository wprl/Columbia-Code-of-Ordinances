<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the duty of the person issued a building permit 
to apply for an amended building 
permit if the total floor area of new construction of a structure exceeds the amount stated in the 
building permit application. The application for an amended building permit shall be made prior 
to final inspection. If a building permit is amended to increase the total floor area of new 
construction, an additional development charge shall be paid for the increased area. The 
additional development charge shall be paid at or before the time the certificate of occupancy is 
issued. If a building permit is amended to decrease the total floor area of new construction, a 
proportionate refund of the development charge paid shall be made to the person issued the 
building permit.</div>
