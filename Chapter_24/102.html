have the right to appeal the denial 
in the following manner:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) days of the denial 
of the request, the appeal shall be taken to the city 
manager, who will hear the appeal within three (3) days of the request.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the city manager upholds the 
denial of the parade permit, the appealing party may, 
within three (3) days of the denial, appeal to a subcommittee of the city council appointed by the 
mayor at the time of the appeal. The subcommittee shall hear the appeal within five (5) days of 
the time the notice has been taken.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the permit is still denied, 
the appealing party may, by filing notice within five (5) days 
of the above finding, bring his appeal before the entire city council at its next regular meeting.</div>
