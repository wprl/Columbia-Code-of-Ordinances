<p class=texthead>Section 24-3 Disposition of articles placed in any street or sidewalk.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any article placed in or upon any street, sidewalk, alley, 
thoroughfare or other public place 
within the city contrary to ordinance, or any such article lost or abandoned in such place, shall be 
taken up and delivered into the custody of the chief of police, who shall notify the owner thereof, 
if known, that the same may be redeemed within five (5) days of such notice by paying to the 
chief of police the actual charges incurred in the storage of such articles, but not less than fifty 
cents ($0.50) for each day of such storage. If the owner fails to redeem such article within the 
time specified, or if such owner is unknown or cannot be found, then, and in that event, the chief 
of police shall post notices in five (5) places in the city describing the article as accurately and 
briefly as possible, and notifying the public that on a certain day and hour named therein, which 
shall be at least ten (10) days subsequent to such notice, that he will sell the articles described 
at 
public auction to the highest bidder for cash at a public place. In case no bidders appear at such 
sale, the chief of police may sell such articles at private sale, securing the best possible price. 
From the proceeds of any such sale held hereunder, the chief of police shall first deduct his 
expenses and pay the balance into the city treasury; and such sum shall become a part of the 
general revenue fund. If, within six (6) months after the sale of such article, as above provided, 
the owner of any such article so sold shall exhibit to the city council satisfactory proof of his 
ownership, the proceeds coming into the city treasury from such sale shall be refunded to him.</div>
