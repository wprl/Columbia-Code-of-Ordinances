<p class=texthead>Section 24-103 Standards for upholding permit denial.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No denial of issuance of a parade permit shall be upheld 
unless the person or body hearing the 
appeal finds that:</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of the parade will 
substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of 
other traffic contiguous to its route;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of the parade will 
require such diversion of so great a number of police 
officers of the city to properly police the line of movement and the area contiguous thereto as to 
prevent normal police protection to the city;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of such parade will 
require the diversion of so great a number of 
ambulances as to prevent normal ambulance service to portions of the city other than that to be 
occupied by the proposed line of march and areas contiguous thereto;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concentration of persons, 
animals and vehicles at assembly points of the parade will 
unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas 
contiguous to such assembly areas;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of such parade will 
interfere with the movement of firefighting equipment 
en route to a fire;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parade is not scheduled to 
move from its point of origin to its point of termination 
expeditiously and without unreasonable delays en route; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parade is to be held for the 
sole purpose of advertising any product, goods or event, 
and is designed to be held purely for private profit.</div>
