<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) No landscape material shall be planted on public street 
right-of-way unless it is listed on 
the &quot;schedule of approved landscape material for street right-of-way planting&quot; dated September 
30, 1993, on file in the office of the director of public works, or unless it has been approved for 
planting by the director of public works. The director of public works shall approve landscape 
material for planting on public street right-of-way only if it is either native to or adaptable to this 
region.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) No tree shall be placed within four (4) feet, measured 
horizontally, of any underground 
utility.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Root barriers in accordance with city standards must 
be approved for any tree planting 
between the sidewalk and curb where the overall distance between the sidewalk and curb is four 
(4) feet or less, except for those indicated on the schedule of approved landscape materials as not 
requiring root barriers. In spaces greater than four (4) feet, the requirement of root barriers shall 
be determined based upon actual clearance and species of trees planted.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Landscape materials over thirty (30) inches in height 
measured from the top of curb shall 
be located so as not to cause sight distance obstructions from intersecting streets or private 
driveways. Hedges shall not be planted or maintained between the sidewalk and curb. General 
sight distance guidelines are on file in the public works department but shall be subject to local 
topographic conditions and traffic volumes.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) No tree shall be planted under a utility line unless 
it is of a species which at maturity will 
provide a minimum of five (5) feet clearance between the apex of the tree and the lowest utility 
line.</div>
