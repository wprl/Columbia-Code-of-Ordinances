<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of police for the city 
of Columbia is authorized to deploy or move downtown 
safety cameras for the purpose of enhancing public security.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before deploying or moving an 
existing downtown safety camera, the chief of police 
shall provide public notice of such deployment or proposed movement. &nbsp;The notice shall identify 
the public security concerns that have been considered in the decision to deploy or move the 
downtown safety camera as well as the general capabilities and viewing area of the downtown 
safety camera. &nbsp;The public shall have thirty (30) days to submit comments to the chief of police 
regarding a proposed deployment or movement, and the chief of police shall provide public 
notice of the chief&#146;s decision regarding deployment or movement in light of public comment.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exigent circumstances, the 
chief of police is authorized to deploy or move downtown 
safety cameras without the public notice or comment periods referred to in subsection (b), but 
only for so long as such exigent circumstances justify deployment or movement.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video recordings shall be indexed, 
stored and maintained for sixty (60) calendar days 
after which time they will be recorded over or destroyed. &nbsp;Recordings may be retained beyond 
sixty (60) calendar days upon written order from the chief of police and only because the 
recordings contain evidence of criminal activity, because the recordings capture an occurrence 
that may subject the Columbia police department to civil liability, or because the recordings will 
be used for training purposes. &nbsp;Recordings that contain evidence of criminal activity or 
recordings that capture an occurrence that may subject the Columbia police department to civil 
liability shall be maintained only for so long as the recordings have evidentiary value. 
Recordings that will be used for training purposes may be maintained only for so long as they are 
actively used for training purposes.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager is authorized 
to enter into agreements with private contractors who 
supply and operate and maintain downtown safety cameras and related tapes and equipment and 
who agree to operate the downtown safety cameras pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.</div>
