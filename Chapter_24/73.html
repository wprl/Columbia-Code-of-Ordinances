<p class=texthead>Section 24-73 Special event permits.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city manager shall designate 
a city event committee to assist with the issuance of 
special event permits. &nbsp;The city event committee is authorized to close any public street, sidewalk 
or public place as follows:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any event in the downtown area;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any event that is ticketed, has entry fees, for-profit 
or otherwise excludes the general 
public;</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any event at a city park if submitted by the director 
of the parks and recreation 
department; and</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any event in other public places if submitted by the 
city manager.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>For purposes of this article, &quot;downtown area&quot; means the area bound on the 
north by Park 
Avenue, on the east by College Avenue, on the south by Elm Street and on the west by 
Providence Road. &nbsp;Issuance of a special event permit does not obligate or require the city to 
provide services, equipment or personnel in support of an event. The city manager may cancel or 
postpone a special event permit if the manager thinks that any denial condition listed in this 
section exists, or is likely to exist, or to otherwise protect people and property in the city. &nbsp;The 
city event committee may promulgate forms and regulations to assist applicants that are not 
inconsistent with this section. The city event committee may request detailed plans, evidence, 
maps or other documentation to evaluate the application. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city event committee shall not 
approve closing any area as set out in subsection (a) 
above for any of the following: </div>
<br>
<div align=left>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before, or the day of, any scheduled University of 
Missouri home football game; 
and </div>
<br>
<div align=left>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any event that requires city services, equipment or support 
that is outside the ordinary 
course of business of the city.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>Any closures of this kind shall require an agreement negotiated by the city manager 
with the 
event organizer and the agreement must be approved by the city council. </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for a special event 
permit shall be considered in the order that the 
application is received. &nbsp;Multiple applications shall be given an order of priority by the applicant 
if submitted by one applicant, or shall be selected at random if it cannot determine the order in 
which applications have been received. &nbsp;Applications for special event permits shall be submitted 
ninety (90) days prior to the first day of the event. &nbsp;A one hundred dollar ($100.00) processing 
fee will be required with the application. &nbsp;As part of the application, the applicant shall present 
evidence that all owners or occupants of property abutting the street to be closed have been 
notified of the proposed street closure and over fifty percent (50%) must give consent for an 
application to be considered. Upon request by the city event committee, applicants shall submit 
detailed plans, evidence or maps to be used to evaluate the application and to address any denial 
condition concerns. &nbsp;The city event committee shall approve or deny the application as soon as 
possible but no later than forty-five (45) days before the first day of the event. &nbsp;Any person 
aggrieved by a denial of a permit by the city event committee may file an appeal within five (5) 
days following such denial with the city council to be acted upon at the next regular council 
meeting after said appeal is filed. &nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city event committee shall 
grant a special event permit unless it is determined that 
one or more of the denial conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) or (d)(2) below requires denial. 
The city event committee shall accept timely written comments from the downtown community 
improvement district board as to any of the denial conditions listed below if the event is in the 
community improvement district area. </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city event committee shall deny a special event permit 
to an applicant who fails to:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a completed and signed application; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meets the requirements for submitting an application for 
a special event permit; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a sufficient traffic control plan; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a plan or evidence of sufficient monitors, event 
staff, volunteers or security for 
crowd control and safety; or </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a plan or evidence of sufficient sanitation or 
portable sanitation equipment, services 
or facilities that are reasonably necessary to ensure that the event will be conducted with due 
regard for safety, health and the &nbsp;public welfare; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a plan or evidence of sufficient waste management 
services; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide sufficient off-site parking or shuttle service, 
or both, when required to minimize any 
substantial adverse impacts on general parking and traffic circulation in the vicinity of the event 
as determined by the city event committee; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain the written approval of any other public agency 
within whose jurisdiction the special 
event or portion of the special event will occur; or </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a sufficient public safety plan based on event 
risk factors including but not limited 
to, on-site medical personnel, emergency preparedness for adverse weather conditions, 
temperature, fire, or other potential health and public safety concerns; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain all other required city permits; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide insurance to protect the city against loss from 
liability imposed by law for damages 
on account of bodily injury and property damage arising from the special event that impacts or 
occurs on city property. The amount, if the insurance is required, shall be determined by the city 
and the insurance shall name the city as an additional insured and must be maintained for the 
duration of the special event. &nbsp;The city manager may waive or require a substitute to the 
insurance requirement only if the event organizer demonstrates that it is impossible or 
impractical to obtain insurance coverage.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city event committee shall 
deny a special event permit if it determines that:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event will violate any local, state or federal law 
or regulation; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resources required to ensure public safety within the 
special event venue or district will 
prevent the police, fire or emergency medical service departments from providing reasonable 
protections to the remainder of the city; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concentrations of persons, animals, or vehicles within 
the special event venue or district 
will unduly interfere with the movement of police, fire, ambulance or other emergency vehicles; 
or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event will substantially interfere with any other special 
event for which a permit has 
been granted, or the combination of events, although they do not interfere, diminishes public 
safety resources to unacceptable levels in the determination of the city; or </div>
<br>
<div align=justify>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event &nbsp;will interfere with scheduled and unscheduled 
government functions, including, 
but not limited to, construction of buildings (public and private), road and utility work, street 
closures, or any other reason to protect safety, health and the public welfare in the city; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event organizer demonstrates an inability or an unwillingness 
to conduct an event in 
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, or to comply with a condition to a permit 
issued under this chapter; or</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event organizer conducted a prior special event in 
a manner that failed to substantially 
comply with city code requirements.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city council shall not close 
a street or sidewalk and issue a special use permit when 
an applicant appeals the denial of a permit or in approving an agreement unless it determines 
that:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No safety hazard will be created, and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No obstruction will be created that would unreasonably 
interfere with police, fire or health 
protection of the city, and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unreasonable interference with the normal uses of the 
abutting property will be created.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following restrictions and 
obligations apply after a street or sidewalk closure has 
been granted as part of a special use permit:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No vendors may operate within 
the closed street without the permission of the special 
event permit holder. &nbsp;This subsection shall not prevent the owners of businesses adjacent to the 
closed street from selling items on the sidewalk as otherwise permitted by law.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No peddler shall conduct peddling&nbsp;within seven hundred 
fifty (750) feet of a street closed 
under this section without the written permission of the city manager. &nbsp;The manager shall not 
give such written permission without first consulting with the special event permit holder to 
determine whether such peddling will interfere with the special event to be held on the closed 
street.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unreasonable interference with the normal uses of the 
abutting property will be created. 
Access to businesses that abut the street closure shall be maintained during the normal business 
hours of the affected business. &nbsp;No entry fee shall be charged to a person who resides or operates 
a business in the closed street area or to a customer of or person making delivery to a business or 
residence in the closed street area.</div>
