<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to top any tree on 
public property. Topping is defined as 
the systematic cutting back of limbs from the tree's crown to such a degree as to remove the 
normal canopy and disfigure the tree.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) This section shall not apply to trees which the city 
arborist or city forester has determined 
are severely damaged by storms, are located directly beneath utility lines or are in need of 
pruning and other pruning practices are impractical.</div>
