<p class=texthead>Section 24-35 Sidewalks required.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No permit shall be issued for the construction of a new building 
on property located on an 
arterial or collector street and zoned for a commercial, office or multi-family use unless a 
sidewalk exists adjacent to the property along the arterial or collector street or unless the plans 
for the building provide for the construction of such a sidewalk. &nbsp;The requirements of this section 
shall not apply to construction of accessory buildings.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any building 
described in subsection (a) if 
the building plans provide for construction of a sidewalk along an arterial or collector street 
unless the sidewalk has been constructed or the property owner has provided a bond, letter of 
credit or other instrument acceptable to the director of public works guaranteeing construction of 
the sidewalk within six (6) months of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. </div>
<br>
<div align=left>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon application of the property owner, the city council 
shall waive the requirement of this 
section to provide plans for and construct a sidewalk if the council determines that the sidewalk 
is not needed or that the impact of the proposed development does not justify the requirement 
that the sidewalk be constructed or that there is a reasonable likelihood that the sidewalk would 
have to be removed and reconstructed in the near future. &nbsp;The granting of a waiver shall not 
affect the power of the city council to later install sidewalks adjacent to the property and levy 
special assessments against the property for construction of the sidewalks.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the need for the sidewalk and whether the 
impact of the proposed 
development justifies the requirement that the sidewalk be built, the City Council shall consider 
all relevant factors such as:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedestrian traffic generators such 
as parks and schools in the area, </div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the existence of a sidewalk network 
in the area,</div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the density of current and future 
development in the area,</div>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the amount of pedestrian 
traffic likely to be generated by the proposed development,</span></font></div>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cost of constructing the sidewalk,</span></font></div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the terrain is such that 
a sidewalk is physically feasible, and </div>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the extent to which trees, ground 
cover and natural areas would be impacted by the 
sidewalk.</div>
