<p class=texthead>Section 12-37 Same--Practices not prohibited.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Notwithstanding any provision in section 12-36 it shall 
be not unlawful for an employer, 
employment agency or labor organization:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take any action otherwise prohibited 
under section 12-36 where age is a bona fide 
occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular 
business, or where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To observe the terms of a bona 
fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit 
plan such as a retirement, pension or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the 
purposes of section 12-36, except that no such employee benefit plan shall excuse the failure to 
fire any individual, and no such seniority system or employee benefit plan shall require or permit 
the involuntary retirement of any individual because of the age of such individual.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To discharge or otherwise discipline 
an individual for good cause.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Nothing in section 12-36 shall be construed to prohibit 
compulsory retirement of any 
employee:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has attained sixty-five (65) 
years of age but not seventy (70) years of age, and who, 
for the two-year period immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or a 
high policymaking position, if such employee is entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable annual 
retirement benefit from a pension, profit sharing, savings, or deferred compensation plan, or any 
combination of such plans, of the employer of such employee, which equals, in the aggregate, at 
least twenty-seven thousand dollars ($27,000.00). In applying the retirement benefit test above, if 
any such retirement benefit is in the form other than a straight life annuity (with no ancillary 
benefits), or if employees contribute to any such plan or make rollover contributions, such 
benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the secretary, after 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, so that the benefit is the equivalent of a straight 
life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and 
under which no rollover contributions are made.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has attained sixty-five (65) 
years of age but not seventy (70) years of age, and who 
is serving under a contract of unlimited tenure (or similar arrangement providing for unlimited 
tenure) at an institution of higher education (as defined by section 1201(a) of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965).</div>
