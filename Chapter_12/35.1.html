<p class=texthead>Section 12-35.1 Service animals in places of public accommodation.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this section, &#147;service 
animal&#148; means any dog that is individually trained to do 
work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, 
sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be unlawful for any person 
owning or operating a place of public accommodation 
to prohibit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person owning or operating a place 
of public accommodation may ask an individual 
with a disability to remove a service animal from the premises if the animal is out of control and 
the animal&#146;s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not 
housebroken. &nbsp;If a service animal is properly excluded, the individual with a disability shall 
be 
given the opportunity to obtain goods, services and accommodations without having the service 
animal on the premises.</div>
