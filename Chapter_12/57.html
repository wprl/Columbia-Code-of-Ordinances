<p class=texthead>Section 12-57 Same--Investigation, resolution.</p>
<p>
<body>
<div align=left>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before investigating a complaint, the investigator shall 
determine if the complainant and 
respondent are willing to resolve the issues raised in the complaint through mediation or some 
other method of dispute resolution. &nbsp;If the complainant and respondent are willing, the 
investigator shall facilitate dispute resolution. &nbsp;The complainant and respondent may engage in 
dispute resolution at any stage in the process. &nbsp;If the complainant and respondent resolve the 
dispute prior to investigation, the case shall be closed.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complainant and respondent are unwilling to attempt 
dispute resolution or are 
unsuccessful in such an attempt, the investigator shall promptly investigate the allegations of the 
complaint.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the investigation, the investigator shall 
report to the commission the 
results of the investigation and the investigator&#146;s opinion on whether there is probable cause 
to 
credit the allegations of the complaint.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the investigator&#146;s report, the commission 
may direct further investigation. 
When the commission is satisfied that the complaint has been properly investigated, it shall 
determine whether there is probable cause to credit the allegations of the complaint. If the 
commission determines that there is no probable cause, it shall dismiss the complaint. &nbsp;If the 
commission determines that there is probable cause, it shall attempt to have the issue resolved 
through mediation or some other method of dispute resolution. &nbsp;If the respondent is unwilling to 
participate in dispute resolution, the commission may forward the matter to the city prosecutor.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any stage in the process, the commission may close the 
case for good administrative 
reasons. &nbsp;Such reasons shall include but not be limited to the following:</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complainant has failed to cooperate 
with the commission.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission is unable to locate 
the complainant or respondent.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complainant wishes to withdraw 
the complaint.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject matter of the complaint 
has been satisfactorily investigated and resolved by 
another governmental agency.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complainant has filed a lawsuit 
against respondent involving the subject matter of 
the complaint.</div>
