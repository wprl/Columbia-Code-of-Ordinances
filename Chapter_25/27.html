<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Following the approval of the preliminary plat of a major 
subdivision or completion of the 
concept review for a minor subdivision, the subdivider may file an application for final plat 
approval with the director, in order to complete the subdivision process. The application shall:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be accompanied by a check made 
payable to the City of Columbia, sufficient to cover all 
plat recording fees established by the Boone County Recorder of Deeds;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include the entire subdivision, 
or a section thereof, which derives access from an existing 
road;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be accompanied by a minimum of 
nine (9) copies of the final plat and three (3) copies of 
the construction plans as described herein;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be in substantial compliance with 
the preliminary plat, as approved;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final plat shall be accompanied 
by final construction plans for the requisite public 
improvements, drawn under the supervision of a registered professional engineer and attested to 
by his signature and seal, all in accordance with the applicable standards;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be accompanied by an improvements 
guarantee offered for acceptance by the city 
council, in a form satisfactory to the city counselor.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The director shall refer the proposed plat to the appropriate 
city departments, together with 
an indication of its tentative agenda placement before the council, and shall receive reports from 
each department as to its conformance with these regulations and the approved preliminary plat.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) As a result of review by the other departments, the director 
shall request the subdivider to 
make such changes necessary to cause the plat to be in conformance with the regulations 
contained herein and the preliminary plat.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) For a major subdivision, the director shall forward the 
plat to the city manager for council 
consideration and advise the council as to its conformance or nonconformance with the 
regulations contained herein. The city manager shall certify to the council that the final plat is in 
accordance with the approved preliminary plat and that all conditions precedent established by 
the council have been met. Following certification by the city manager to the council, the council 
shall take action on the final plat.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) For a minor subdivision, the director shall forward the 
plat to the commission and advise 
the commission as to its conformance or nonconformance with the regulations contained herein. 
The commission shall take action on the plat in the manner prescribed for preliminary plats.</div>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The council shall take action by ordinance on the final 
plat within forty-five (45) calendar 
days after its submission to the council, and failure of the council to act within that time period 
shall be deemed approval, except that the council, with the consent of the subdivider, may extend 
this period to a stated future date.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Revision. No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions 
shall be made on any final plat 
of a subdivision after approval has been given by the council, and endorsed in writing on the plat, 
unless the plat is first resubmitted and reapproved by the council.</div>
