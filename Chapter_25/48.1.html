<p class=texthead>Section 25-48.1 Sidewalks generally (plats approved after January 1, 2001).</p>

<body>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
Sidewalks shall be constructed within all pedestrian easements and on both sides of all 
internal streets and on the abutting side of any adjacent street unless otherwise specified in this 
chapter. </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
A sidewalk shall not be required along a residential access street which is less than two 
hundred-fifty (250) feet in length and terminates in a cul-de-sac. Sidewalks shall be a minimum 
of five (5) feet in width along all other streets.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The city council may require a sidewalk to be constructed 
to standards higher than the 
minimum standards of this chapter; provided, that the city compensate the property owner for the 
additional cost of constructing the sidewalk.</div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A request for a variance to any sidewalk requirement or 
standard may be filed in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 25-20. &nbsp;A variance to the requirement to construct a 
sidewalk may be conditioned on the property owner &nbsp;paying the city an amount equivalent to the 
cost of construction of a standard sidewalk; provided however, where an alternate walkway 
system is approved as a substitute for <font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
standard</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;sidewalks, no payment shall be required. &nbsp;</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
Each</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp; 
payment collected shall be used solely to construct or improve </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
a</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;sidewalk </span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
or other pedestrian 
infrastructure improvement that benefits the property for which the payment was collected. &nbsp;In 
cases where no equivalent payment has been made or no alternate walkway system has been 
approved, the grant of a variance to the requirement that a sidewalk be constructed shall not 
affect the power of the city council to later install a sidewalk adjacent to the property and levy a 
special assessment against the property for construction of the sidewalk.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Sidewalks shall be constructed to comply with the standards 
contained herein and with the 
city design standards and specifications established by the director of public works or adopted by 
the council. &nbsp;Sidewalks shall be installed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for 
the 
subject property unless otherwise specified as a note on the plat or in a performance contract 
between the developer and the city.</div>

Where a final plat creates a common lot or a non-buildable lot, a sidewalk shall be 
constructed along the portion of each street abutting the lot at the same time the abutting street is 
constructed. &nbsp;Where a final plat creates a common lot or a non-buildable lot adjacent to an 
existing street, a sidewalk shall be constructed along the portion of the street abutting the lot no 
later than one year after approval of the final plat.</span></div>
