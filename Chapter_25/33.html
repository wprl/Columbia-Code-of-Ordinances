<p class=texthead>Section 25-33 Tract spilt--Generally.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In order to facilitate the orderly subdivision of large 
tracts of land for separate parcel sale, 
the tract split procedure may be used, by which subdivision authorization is given 
administratively, and ordinary subdivision plat preparation, review and commission or council 
approval is not required. The tract split procedure is not intended to and does not exempt 
property from normal subdivision platting and improvement requirements for its development, in 
accord with these and other applicable regulations. It may, however, provide a means by which 
those platting and public improvement responsibilities can be placed primarily with the 
developer of such land, parcel by parcel, at the time such development actually occurs, rather 
than at the time of initial large-tract subdivision into suitably smaller parcels for separate sale.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Application for approval of a tract split shall be made 
to the director. The application shall:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be on forms supplied by the director;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be accompanied by drawings, sketc.hes 
or written information and documentation 
sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the definition of &quot;tract split&quot; in section 25-3, 
and the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, section 25-54, and all other requirements of this 
chapter.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Upon filing of an application for approval of a tract 
split, the director shall examine the 
same, in the nature of a concept review, and consult with other city departments as he may deem 
necessary. No tract split shall be approved by the director unless he determines that the proposed 
tract split meets the following criteria:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property shall be divided 
into not more than five (5) parcels.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate provision shall be made 
for future subdivision of the resultant parcels for 
development, for the opening of future streets to serve the parcels, and for the extension of 
utilities or related public improvements and facilities, in accordance with normal requirements.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resultant parcel configuration 
shall not adversely affect development of the balance of 
the tract or parcels, nor of adjoining properties, nor be in conflict with any provision of the 
comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance, or other provision of these regulations.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The director shall approve or disapprove the request, 
and notify the subdivider in writing 
of such action within fourteen (14) calendar days of filing of the application.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The director, on approval of a tract split, shall certify 
to the recorder of deeds that the 
survey required hereunder complies with all the provisions of this chapter.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) If the director disapproves the tract split or fails 
to approve or disapprove the same within 
fourteen (14) days, the subdivider may within five (5) days after the expiration of such fourteen-day 
period, request the director to transmit the tract split to the commission for its approval or 
disapproval. The request shall be in writing and dated and signed by the subdivider or his duly 
authorized agent. Upon such written request, the director shall transmit the tract split to the 
commission. The commission shall approve or disapprove the tract split at its next regular 
meeting which is not less than seven (7) days after the date shown on the written request to the 
director to transmit the tract split to the commission.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) The commission shall forward the tract split and its 
recommendation thereon to the city 
council for consideration at the council's next regular meeting which is not less than three (3) 
days after the date of the commission's consideration. The city council shall approve or 
disapprove the tract split at the regular meeting. Failure of the city council to act within the time 
prescribed shall be deemed approval.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Except as may otherwise be provided, no permit for street 
or utility extension, nor permit 
for building development, shall be issued for any of the resultant parcels, unless or until such 
parcel or portion thereof has been platted in accordance with this chapter.</div>
