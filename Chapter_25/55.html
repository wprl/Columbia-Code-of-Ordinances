<i>Flood-prone areas.</i> Any portion of land being subdivided which is located within the limits 
of maximum flooding of the 100-year flood, as determined by December 1, 1981, flood insurance 
rate maps and amendments thereto on file with the director of public works, shall be developed 
so as not to endanger the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants thereof, and in 
compliance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance related thereto.</span></div>

<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Storm sewers.</i> Storm sewers with curbs and gutters shall be provided for lots; however, 
open channels may be allowed where deemed appropriate and when design features, such as 
vegetated swales and check dams, are used to reduce runoff velocity and allow infiltration. 
Sidewalks and pedways shall not be located between the street and open channel. &nbsp;Improvements 
shall conform to standards contained in the city street and storm sewer specifications and design 
standards, and the city storm drainage standards, and all applicable design standards and 
specifications now or hereafter promulgated by the director of public works or adopted by the 
council.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Driveways across drainage features.</i> Driveways that cross drainageways or ditches to 
connect to public streets shall be constructed in a manner and method approved by the director of 
public works consistent with the public health, safety and welfare.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Streets crossing streams.</i> Streets that cross streams shall be designed and constructed in a
