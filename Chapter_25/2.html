<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control the 
subdivision of land within the 
corporate limits of the city. The sale of land requires a subdivision or tract split as defined in this 
chapter. These controls are deemed necessary to promote the public health, safety and general 
welfare of the city. They are designed to provide for the safe, orderly and economic use of 
transportation; to facilitate orderly layout and use of the land; to ensure proper legal description 
and monumenting of subdivided land; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to 
provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue 
concentrations of population; to facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, 
parks, schools, playgrounds and other requirements; and to facilitate the further subdivision of 
larger tracts into smaller tracts of land.</div>
