<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Before preparing the preliminary plat of a major subdivision 
or the final plat of a minor 
subdivision, the subdivider shall discuss with the director the procedure for adoption of a 
subdivision plat and the requirements as to general layout of streets and for reservations of land, 
street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection and similar matters, as well as the 
availability of existing services. The director shall also advise the applicant, when appropriate, to 
discuss the proposed subdivision with those city officials who must recommend approval of 
certain aspects of the subdivision plat coming within their jurisdiction. This concept review shall 
be an informal review of land use and development concepts, pertinent regulations and required 
public improvements. The geographic scope of this review shall include the whole property held 
in common ownership for which whole or partial subdivision platting is desired by the 
subdivider, as well as the surrounding property which might reasonably be affected by 
subdivision of the subject property.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The concept review is an informal discussion and review 
made available to the subdivider, 
and the subdivider may, after meeting with the director, proceed to prepare and submit a 
preliminary or final plat, as required for the classification of the subdivision as a major or minor 
subdivision.</div>
