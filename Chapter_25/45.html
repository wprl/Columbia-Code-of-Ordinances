<p class=texthead>Section 25-45 Curves.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curves shall comply with the following design criteria unless 
the director of public works 
determines that a more restrictive requirement is necessary to safeguard the public health, safety 
and general welfare from potentially hazardous street design.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When street pavement lines or 
street right-of-way lines deflect, the lines shall be 
connected by a horizontal curve having a maximum degree of center line curvature of 57&deg; 29' for 
local residential streets, 25&deg; 00' for local nonresidential streets, 12&deg; 30' for collector streets, 
7&deg; 30' 
for arterial streets, and 5&deg; 00' for freeways, except that street right-of-way lines may deflect, 
provided the deflection angle is less than or equal to 10&deg; 00'.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tangent segment at least two 
hundred (200) feet in length shall be maintained between 
curves on all streets, except for local residential streets.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All vertical grade changes shall 
be connected by vertical curves of sufficient length to 
provide a smooth transition and proper sight distance. Vertical grade changes of two (2) percent 
or less algebraically may be connected by chords if the design engineer encounters unusual 
circumstances such as facilitating drainage; however, sight distances must be maintained.</div>
