&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Application for preliminary plat.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application shall include all land which the 
subdivider proposes to subdivide. All 
contiguous unplatted land under single ownership or control shall be included as part of the 
preliminary plat; however, no more than eighty (80) acres shall be required to be included in any 
preliminary plat. A preliminary plat which does not comply with this subsection (1) shall not be 
accepted for review. The application shall show all land which is immediately adjacent to the 
property proposed for subdivision, with the name of all subdivisions immediately adjacent, and 
for unsubdivided areas, the property owners as disclosed by records in the county assessor's 
office. This information may be shown on a separate map or exhibit.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application shall be accompanied by a minimum 
of nine (9) copies at the time of 
filing, with ten (10) additional copies to be provided by the applicant at the time of referral of the 
preliminary plat to the commission for review and recommendation.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The director shall refer the proposed preliminary plat to the appropriate 
city departments, 
together with an indication of its tentative agenda placement before the commission, and shall 
receive reports from the departments as to the conformance of the proposed plat with this 
chapter.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The director shall request the subdivider to make such changes to the plat 
as are necessary 
to cause the plat to be in conformance with the regulations and design standards contained 
herein.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The director shall forward the plat to the commission and advise the commission 
of the 
conformance or nonconformance of the plat with these regulations and standards.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) After the commission has reviewed the preliminary plat, it shall approve, 
approve 
conditionally or disapprove the preliminary plat.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Failure of the commission to act within forty-five (45) calendar days after 
the date of 
application of the plat shall be deemed approval, except that the commission or director, with the 
consent of the subdivider, may extend this period to a stated future date.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) If the commission approves a preliminary plat, a notation to that effect 
shall be made on 
the original tracing. If the commission approves the preliminary plat conditionally, a notation of 
the conditions or a reference to the same shall be entered on the original tracing itself and a 
record of the conditions shall be maintained in the city clerk's office. If the commission 
disapproves the preliminary plat, a notation shall not be made on the original tracing, but the 
commission shall forward a recommendation for disapproval with the reasons therefor to the 
council and such recommendation and reasons for disapproval shall be made a matter of record 
on the city clerk's office. The council, by a vote of not less than two-thirds of its entire 
membership, may overrule the disapproval.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) The preliminary plat shall be forwarded to the council with the recommendation 
of the 
planning and zoning commission. The council shall take action on the plat by resolution.</span></font></div>
<br>

plat was given approval shall not 
be changed.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subdivider may submit on or before the expiration
