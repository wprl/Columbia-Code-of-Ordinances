greater than those required by 
this chapter or other city ordinances, which in the opinion of the director may affect the division 
and use of the land as contemplated by the subdivider, shall be indicated on the subdivision plat 
by a statement of such restrictions or by reference to the recordation of such restrictions in the

&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such restrictions may be eliminated only by
