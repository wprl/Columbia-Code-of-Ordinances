<p class=texthead>Section 25-42 Street improvements generally.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streets and curbs and gutters shall be improved to comply with the standards 
contained herein, 
and in the city street and storm sewer specifications and design standards, and all design 
standards and specifications now or hereafter promulgated by the director of public works or 
adopted by the council, in accordance with the final construction plans required to be approved 
prior to final plat approval.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Responsibility for improvements costs.</i> It 
is the policy of the city to participate in or 
contribute only to certain additional costs of construction of major thoroughfares over and above 
the normal costs of local standard streets, when streets are designated at higher standards by the 
city. Such participation, and its timing, is not mandated and is solely at the election of the 
council, according to the needs of the community.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Arrangement.</i> All </span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
streets</span><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;shall be located properly with respect to extending existing and 
platted streets, to traffic generators, to population densities, and to the pattern of existing and 
proposed land uses.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
Local streets shall be designed to provide convenient and safe access to all properties 
and to permit efficient drainage and utility systems. &nbsp;The use of through streets shall be 
encouraged to connect adjoining areas and to facilitate the delivery of public and emergency 
services; however, straight streets more than 800 feet long shall be avoided to discourage 
speeding. &nbsp;Individual local residential street segments should serve no more than 50 dwelling 
units without additional street connections. &nbsp;Local streets with connections to arterial and 
collector streets shall be designed to avoid cut-through traffic. &nbsp;Curvilinear streets are encouraged 
to minimize speeding and the amount of grading. &nbsp;Cul-de-sacs and loop (U-shaped) streets should 
be short in length, less prevalent than through streets, and may be especially appropriate to avoid 
steep slopes, major creeks, floodplains, wetlands and other sensitive environmental areas.</span><font 
color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
A 
street connectivity index (consisting of the number of intersections divided by the combined 
number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) shall be calculated for proposed new subdivisions.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a subdivision abuts 
or contains an existing arterial street or highway having 
limited access, the commission may require the arrangement of residential lots with rear yards 
abutting the major street, or the provision of frontage roads, or other such treatment as may be 
necessary in order to provide for adequate protection of residential properties, to afford 
separation of through and local traffic, and to provide for suitable access to the property 
involved.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
Interconnection of adjacent subdivisions with compatible land uses shall be encouraged. 
&nbsp;When a new subdivision adjoins unplatted or undeveloped land, the new streets shall be carried 
to the boundaries of such land unless vehicular access is unnecessary or inappropriate. &nbsp;A 
temporary turnaround approved by the director of public works shall be installed at this point, 
except when the terminus of the street is less than three hundred (300) feet from an intersecting 
street right-of-way. &nbsp;Where street connections to adjoining land are not provided and there is 
a 
need for non-vehicular public access to a school, park, trail or other area or use, the city may 
require the dedication and improvement of a green space access easement or green space trail 
easement. &nbsp;Whenever such public improvements are required and the landowner conveys fee title 
in lieu of an easement, the city shall accept ownership and maintenance.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#010101><span 
style="font-size:11pt">
Private drives may be allowed only to provide internal circulation within a single lot or 
parcel, except when approved in conjunction with a planned district.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Blocks.</i> Streets should generally intersect 
at intervals not exceeding one thousand (1,000) 
feet or less than four hundred (400) feet. Blocks shall have sufficient depth to provide for two (2) 
tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block depth shall be encouraged 
in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads or waterways.</span></font></div>
