<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Public provisions.</i> This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any 
other city regulation, ordinance, statute or other provision of law. Where any provision of this 
chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision or regulation, 
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose a higher standard shall control.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Private provisions.</i> This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any 
other private agreement or restriction, provided that where the provisions of this chapter are more 
restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other 
private agreement or restriction, the requirements of this chapter shall govern. When such private 
provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards than the requirements of this chapter 
or the determinations of the commission and the council in approving a subdivision or in 
enforcing these regulations or determinations hereunder, then such private provisions shall be 
operative and supplemental to this chapter and determinations made thereunder.</span></div>
