<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>General.</i> Where the commission finds that undue hardships or practical difficulties may 
result from strict compliance with this chapter, it may recommend and the council may approve 
variances from this chapter so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest 
secured, provided that any such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and 
purpose of this chapter; and further provided, that the commission shall not recommend 
variances unless it finds and determines that:</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The granting of the variance will 
not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare 
or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is 
located;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions upon which the 
request for a variance is based are unique to the property 
for which the variance is sought, are not applicable generally to other property, and are not self-imposed;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the particular physical 
surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the 
specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from 
a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations was carried out; and</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The variance will not in any manner 
abrogate the provisions of the comprehensive plan 
of the city.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Conditions.</i> In recommending variances and exceptions, the commission may recommend 
and the council may require such conditions as will, in the judgment of each, secure substantially 
the objectives of the standards or requirements of this chapter.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Procedures.</i> A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the 
subdivider at the time the preliminary plat is filed for consideration by the commission; provided, 
when cause is shown, such petition may be considered by the commission at any time thereafter. 
The petition shall state fully the grounds for the petition and all the facts relied upon by the 
petitioner.</span></div>
