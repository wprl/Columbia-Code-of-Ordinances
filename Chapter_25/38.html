<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Land shall be neither subdivided nor developed, except 
under appropriate special 
safeguards, where the commission finds that a proposed subdivision or development poses a 
potential or existing threat to the safety, health and general welfare of inhabitants of the land or 
surrounding areas due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse 
earth formations, topography, utility easements or other adverse conditions.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Prior to subdivision or development of any area subject 
to the above adverse conditions, 
the commission shall require a detailed development proposal for the subdivision which 
sufficiently safeguards inhabitants of the land and surrounding areas and their property from such 
potential or existing threat thereto.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Portions of the proposed subdivision or development which 
cannot be prepared properly 
for the development shall be set aside for such use as shall not pose an undue hazard to life and 
property.</div>
