<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Improvements required.</i> All required public improvements, including but not limited to 
streets and utilities, shall be installed or constructed in accordance with the design standards and 
requirements contained in sections 25-27-33, or in related public improvements standard 
specifications or policies established by the city departments charged with responsibility 
therefor.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It is the intention of this chapter to cause completion 
of installation of all water, sewer or 
other underground utilities prior to construction of streets, so that any breaking through of streets 
will be held to an absolute minimum. It is also the intention of this chapter to provide for the 
continued carrying out of existing city policy regarding the installation of street lights, electric 
lines, fire hydrants, water mains and other utilities until such policies are changed by the council.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Inspection and certification.</i> Inspection of required improvements shall be made during 
construction and installation to ensure satisfactory completion thereof, in accordance with 
inspection requirements adopted by the council or promulgated by the city departments charged 
with responsibility therefor.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Disclaimer of estoppel.</i> The level of public improvements established at the time of 
subdivision is taken to be that required to provide an adequate level of service for the land use or 
uses contemplated by the subdivision itself. Approval of a final plat, and acceptance of 
improvements therein by the council, shall not be construed to prevent the council from causing 
public improvements to be enhanced, enlarged or upgraded, in order to accommodate a higher 
level of service demand attendant to any subsequent change in the use of land within the 
subdivision, whether by benefit assessment, agreement among the parties or by such other 
mechanism as may be available now or may subsequently become available to the council.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <span style="font-size:11pt">
<i>Submission of tracings.</i> Upon notice that the improvements have been completed in 
accordance with the city's requirements, the engineer shall, under his seal and signature, submit 
as-built tracings for the street, storm sewer and sanitary sewer construction.<br>
