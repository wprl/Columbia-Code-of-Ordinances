<i>Deeds.</i> It shall be unlawful for any person to file or record with the recorder of deeds of 
Boone County, Missouri, any instrument of sale, transfer or conveyance including a description 
by metes and bounds when the sale or transfer of that land effects a subdivision of land located 
within the corporate limits of the city within the meaning of this chapter and before such land has 
been subdivided in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the plat, if required, has 
been approved by the city council and recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds, Boone 
County, Missouri. Any deed or instrument of sale filed with the county recorder before full 
compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall be deemed to be null and void.</span></div>

<i>Plats.</i> The recorder of deeds of Boone County, Missouri, shall not file or record a 
subdivision plat of any land located within the corporate limits of the city unless the plat has 
endorsed upon it the approval of the council under the hand of the city clerk, and the seal of the 
city or, in the case of an administrative plat, with the signature of the director of public works. 
The plat shall show with particularity what part of the land shown thereon is within the corporate 
limits of the city. The landowner shown on the plat shall cause to be filed with the director a 
statement by a registered land surveyor, set out on the plat and acknowledged by some official 
authorized by law to take acknowledgments or conveyances of real estate, stating that the land so 
shown on the plat as being within the corporate limits of the city is in fact within the corporate 
limits of the city. Any subdivision plat filed with the county recorder before full compliance with 
the requirements of this chapter shall be deemed to be null and void.</span></div>
