<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Any property owner may petition the board of adjustment for a variance from 
strict 
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The petition shall be in writing and shall state 
the grounds for the petition and all facts relied upon by petitioner.</span></font><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;The petition shall include a 
written detailed explanation of all burdens or hardships and how all options available in the 
stormwater manual or under this chapter have been exhausted. &nbsp;The petition shall address in 
detail how the petitioner is in compliance with subsections (b)(1)-(4) and (c) of this section; shall 
include all evidence and support that no adverse downstream impacts exist; and shall list all 
reasonable mitigation measures.</span></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The board of adjustment shall not grant a variance from the requirements 
of this chapter 
unless it shall make all of the following findings:</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good and sufficient cause based on an unreasonable 
burden or hardship has been proved.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The granting of the variance would not result in 
any increase in quantity or velocity of 
flow, degradation of water quality, or negative impacts upon adjoining or downstream properties, 
nor upon the stormwater system.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of variance is the minimum necessary to 
afford relief from the unreasonable 
burden or hardship imposed by the requirements of this chapter;</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The variance may be granted without defeating the 
public health, safety and welfare 
purposes and intent of this chapter.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board may grant a variance 
to the stormwater management requirements of article V 
only if at least one of the following conditions exist:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative requirements for onsite management of stormwater 
discharges have been 
established in a stormwater management plan approved by the director.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an existing 
offsite facility that is adequately 
sized to provide a level of stormwater control at least equal to that which would be afforded by 
onsite practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term maintenance of 
the offsite facility.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board finds that meeting the minimum onsite management 
requirements is not feasible 
because of physical characteristics of the site.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>The board may not vary the stormwater management requirements of article V if the 
variance 
would result in any of the following impacts in the downstream waterway:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deterioration of existing culverts, 
bridges, dams or other structures;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degradation of biological functions 
or habitat;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerated stream bank or stream 
bed erosion or siltation;</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased threat of flood damage.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>If a variance granted by the board will likely result in a lower level of stormwater 
control, the 
board shall impose reasonable mitigation measures including, but not limited to, the following:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase and donation of privately owned lands or 
the grant of an easement to be 
dedicated for preservation or reforestation. &nbsp;These lands must be adjacent to a stream corridor 
in 
order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of a stormwater management facility or 
other drainage improvements on 
previously developed property, whether public or private, which currently lacks stormwater 
management facilities, designed and constructed in accordance with the standards and purposes 
of this chapter and the city&#146;s Stormwater Management and Water Quality Manual.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the petitioner&#146;s request, monetary contributions 
to fund stormwater related studies and 
projects including regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies, hydrologic 
studies, stream assessment studies, including stream monitoring studies for water quality and 
macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies and 
stream restoration projects. &nbsp;The monetary contribution shall be in accordance with a schedule 
established by the director and shall be based on the cubic feet of storage required but not 
provided for the stormwater management of the property in question.</div>
