<p class=texthead>Section 12A-66 Erosion control requirements.</p>
<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A soil erosion control plan shall accompany all applications 
for land disturbance permits. 
The purpose of the plan is to clearly establish what measures will be taken to prevent erosion and 
off site sedimentation during and after development. The erosion control plan shall consist of two 
parts, a site grading and drainage plan and a narrative report describing the nature and scope of 
the work. The plan shall be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, licensed 
in the State of Missouri.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Erosion and sedimentation control measures must be designed 
to provide protection from 
the runoff from a 10-year return frequency, 24-hour duration storm.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) All surfaces must be stable and non-erosive within the 
lesser of thirty (30) working days or 
one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after completion of the work authorized by the land 
disturbance permit. When such work is associated with the construction of a building, no 
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until such surfaces are stable and non-erosive. If 
completion of the work or building is at such time of the year that stabilization with ground cover 
is not possible, a performance bond or other acceptable financial instrument for completion of 
the work may be accepted to allow the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.</div>
