<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stormwater management plan is required for all 
development and redevelopment 
projects subject to this article.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stormwater management plan must be submitted and 
approved by the director before 
issuance of a land disturbance permit and before approval of a final plat or a development plan. 
The stormwater management plan shall be prepared and certified by a registered professional 
engineer licensed in the State of Missouri. &nbsp;</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stormwater management plan must show all components 
of the storm drainage 
system including street curbs, inlets and piping, junction boxes, engineered and natural channels 
and stormwater management facilities (for example, retention and detention ponds, bioswales, 
bioretention areas, etc.). &nbsp;The stormwater management plan may be prepared in conjunction with 
or separate from the soil erosion plan. &nbsp;</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that a preliminary stormwater management 
plan be submitted early in 
the review process to allow time for city staff to discuss plan concepts with the developer. &nbsp;The 
stormwater management plan will be discussed as part of the concept review for any proposed 
development.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stormwater management plan must comply with all 
requirements of the city&#146;s current 
Stormwater Management and Water Quality Manual.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following information must be submitted with 
a stormwater management plan:</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worksheets. &nbsp;All calculations and worksheets used in plan preparation 
and BMP selection. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculations. &nbsp;Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the 
pre-development and 
post-development for the design conditions specified in the Stormwater Management and Water 
Quality Manual. These calculations shall include: description of the design storm frequency, 
intensity and duration; time of concentration; soil curve numbers; peak runoff rates and total 
volumes for the watershed area; infiltration rates where applicable; culvert capacities; flow 
velocities; data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff for the design storms referenced in 
the Stormwater Management and Water Quality Manual; and, documentation of sources for all 
computation methods and field test results.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soils information. &nbsp;When a stormwater management facility relies on 
the hydrologic 
properties of the soils (such as an infiltration basin) the developer shall submit a soils report. The 
soils report shall be based on onsite boring logs or pit profiles. The number and location of 
required soil boring or soil pits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine the 
suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the facility.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landscaping information. &nbsp;The developer must include a detailed landscaping 
and 
vegetative restoration plan as part of the stormwater management plan. Details on maintenance 
of the vegetation shall be included in the operation and maintenance plan. The landscaping plan 
component must be prepared by an individual who can demonstrate knowledge of landscape 
design or by Missouri Department of Conservation personnel.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stormwater management plan must include a written 
operation and maintenance 
manual for the permanent stormwater management facilities, including landscaping and 
vegetative cover, proposed as part of the development. This is required whether the facilities are 
to be publicly or privately maintained. Approval of the operation and maintenance manual is a 
part of the overall plan approval process.</span></font></div>
