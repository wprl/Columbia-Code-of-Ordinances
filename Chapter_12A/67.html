&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The site grading and drainage plan shall include the following:</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Existing features.</i></span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drainage area map showing 
topography of the entire drainage basin(s) contributing to 
the site. The scale of the map shall be no smaller than 1 inch = 200 feet for drainage areas up to 
five hundred (500) acres. A topographic map of appropriate scale shall be provided for larger 
areas upstream from the design area. The drainage map is to show total acreage of the site and 
the acreage of all drainage areas contributing to the site.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=justify><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site plan having a scale 
no smaller than 1 inch = 100 feet and existing contour 
intervals of not more than five (5) feet. The plan shall show topographic features such as 
highways, utilities, natural watercourses, existing drainage facilities and structures, adjacent 
property lines, north arrow, scale, and vicinity map. The site plan is to also show the limits of the 
adopted 100 year flood plain on the site and any critical environmental areas such as streams, 
lakes, ponds and wetlands. Area and geological types of predominant soils as well as the nature 
and extent of existing vegetation shall also be shown on the plan.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plan drawing that shows 
the limits of clearing and grading, cuts and fills, and final 
contours at not more than two (2) feet intervals. The plan shall identify the phasing of the 
grading, showing the area(s) to be denuded and the maximum time those areas will remain 
disturbed (not to exceed the lessor of thirty (30) working days or one hundred twenty (120) 
calendar days after completion of the work). The plan shall show areas to be used for storage of 
topsoil and excavated subsoil and plans for access to the site during wet weather.</span></font><span

facilities.</span></font></div>

drainage patterns and the location of ingress and egress points with the planned protection 
provisions are to be indicated. &#167; 12A-69</span></font></div>
