management facilities shall be ensured through the 
creation of a formal maintenance covenant, which must be approved by the director before final 
plat or plan approval and subsequently be recorded by the City with the Boone County Recorder 
of Deeds. The covenant will include a schedule for maintenance of the facilities to insure proper 
function of each stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include a schedule for 
inspections of each facility to ensure proper function of each stormwater management facility 
between scheduled maintenance functions.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may accept 
dedication of stormwater 
management facilities for City maintenance based on specific criteria developed by the director 
and generally limited to those stormwater management facilities which serve multiple properties. 
Any stormwater management facility accepted by the City for maintenance must meet all the 
requirements of this article and include adequate access easements for inspection and regular 
maintenance.</div>
