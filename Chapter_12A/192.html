&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Applicability.</i> &nbsp;This section applies 
to all facilities which have storm water discharges 
associated with the facility activity including construction activity.</span></font></div>

<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcement officers are authorized to enter and inspect facilities subject 
to regulation 
under this article to determine compliance with this article. &nbsp;If a discharger has security measures 
in force which require proper identification and clearance before entering its premises, the 
discharger shall be given the opportunity to make the necessary arrangements to allow access to 
the enforcement officers. &nbsp;If an enforcement officer is denied entry to the property, the officer 
or 
city prosecutor may apply to the municipal court for a warrant under the provisions of Chapter 15 
of this code.</span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities operators shall allow enforcement officials ready access to all 
parts of the 
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records which 
must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit, or local or other state permits to 
discharge storm water and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and 
federal law. &nbsp;If an enforcement officer is denied such access, the officer or city prosecutor may 
apply to the municipal court for a warrant under the provisions of Chapter 15 of this code.</span></font></div>

<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enforcement officer may install devices on any facility to monitor and 
sample the 
facility&#146;s storm water discharge. &nbsp;If an enforcement officer is not allowed to install such 
a device, 
the officer or city prosecutor may apply to the municipal court for a warrant under the provisions 
of Chapter 15 of this code. </span></font></div>
<br>
<div align=left><font color=#010101><span style="font-size:11pt">
(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An enforcement officer may require a discharger to install monitoring equipment. &nbsp;The 
discharger shall maintain the facility sampling and monitoring equipment at all times in a safe 
and proper operating condition. &nbsp;All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall 
be calibrated to insure their accuracy.</span></font></div>

(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of an enforcement officer, a discharger shall promptly remove 
any 
obstructions to safe and easy access to a facility to be inspected. &nbsp;The obstructions shall not 
be 
replaced. </span></font></div>
