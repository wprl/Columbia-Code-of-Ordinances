accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. &nbsp;If completion of the work or 
structure is at such time of the year that completion of the required stormwater management 
facilities is not feasible, a performance bond or other acceptable financial instrument for the 
estimated cost of completion of the work may be accepted to allow the issuance of a certificate of 
occupancy.</span></font></div>
