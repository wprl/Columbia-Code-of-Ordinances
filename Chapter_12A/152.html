<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stormwater utility charge shall be reduced for the occupant 
or owner of nonresidential 
property where approved runoff control measures have been implemented, provided that all such 
runoff control facilities are privately owned and operated. The charge shall be reduced in 
proportion to the reduction in peak runoff. The director shall determine the percentage reduction 
in the charge, based on the ratio of peak runoff from the modified property to the peak runoff 
from the property without reduction in peak runoff.</div>
