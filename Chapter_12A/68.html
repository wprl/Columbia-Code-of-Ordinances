<p>
<body>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The narrative report describing the nature and scope 
of the work shall include the 
following:</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report shall briefly describe 
the overall project and shall incorporate an explanation 
of existing significant drainage problems contributing to erosion and siltation problems, 
particularly those that will be intensified by the alteration to the construction site.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report shall explain how the 
project design insures that the project does not promote 
or aggravate an existing off-site erosion, siltation, or drainage problem. The narrative should 
include a description of the effect of land disturbance activities off-site.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runoff producing factors under 
existing conditions and the estimated changes after 
construction must be provided.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For design of the erosion control 
measures and facilities, the report shall include 
calculations of the peak runoff from a 10-year return frequency, 24-hour duration storm.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long range management of the erosion 
and siltation control facilities must be addressed 
in the report.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phasing or staging of the 
land disturbing activity is to be described including 
information on the sequence of land clearing operations, specifying the maximum area and time 
span the area will be left denuded, the provisions for the removal, protection and stockpiling of 
soil, the types of major earth moving and grading activities, dust control measures, and the order 
of placement of control facility installations.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanations for the selection 
of the erosion and siltation control measures utilized shall 
be provided.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A schedule shall be provided for 
inspection and maintenance of the erosion and sediment 
control facilities to insure maximum effectiveness of the protective measures and to assure that 
preventive maintenance efforts will be carried out when needed. The report should also include a 
description of plans for resodding or reseeding of vegetated areas and repair of reconstruction of 
damaged structural measures, and the method and frequency of removal and disposal of waste 
materials removed from the control facilities or project area including the disposal of temporary 
structural measures after they have served their purpose.</div>
