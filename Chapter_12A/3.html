<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floods from storm water runoff may occur which exceed the 
capacity of storm drainage 
facilities constructed and maintained as a result of this chapter. This chapter does not guarantee 
that properties will always be free from storm water flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall 
not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, the city or any city officer or 
employee for any flood damage. Neither does this chapter purport to reduce the need or the 
necessity for obtaining flood insurance.</div>
