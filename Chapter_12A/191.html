<p>
<body>
<div align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council may, by ordinance, 
adopt standards identifying best management 
practices (BMP) for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution 
of storm water, the storm drain system, waters of the state or waters of the United States. &nbsp;These 
standards shall be on file in the office of the director. &nbsp;It shall be unlawful for any person 
undertaking any activity or owning or operating any facility subject to such standards to fail to 
comply with the standards.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner or operator of a commercial 
or industrial establishment shall provide 
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the 
municipal separate storm sewer system or water courses through the use of structural and non-structural 
BMPs. &nbsp;Any person responsible for property which is or may be the source of an illicit 
discharge may be required to implement additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent 
further discharge. &nbsp;Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit 
authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity to the extent 
practicable shall be deemed in compliance with provisions of this section. &nbsp;These BMPs shall be 
a part of the storm water pollution prevention plan as necessary for compliance with the 
requirements of the NPDES permit.</div>
