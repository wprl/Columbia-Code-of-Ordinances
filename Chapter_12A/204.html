&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director shall certify the cost of abatement 
to the city clerk. The cost shall include 
administrative costs as well as the actual cost of abating the nuisance. &nbsp;The city clerk shall 
cause 
a special tax bill against the property to be prepared in the amount of the abatement costs. The 
tax bill from the date of its issuance shall be a lien on the property until paid and shall be prima 
facie evidence of the recitals therein and of its validity. &nbsp;No clerical error or informality in 
the tax 
bill or in the proceedings leading up to the issuance of the tax bill shall be a defense in an action 
to collect the tax bill. &nbsp;Tax bills issued under this section, if not paid when due, shall bear 
interest 
at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum.</span></font></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of abatement shall also constitute a personal 
obligation of the owner of the 
property and of any other person who caused the nuisance.</span></font></div>
